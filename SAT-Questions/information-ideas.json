[{"ID": "016e1bae","Question": "Cats can judge unseen people’s positions in space by the sound of their voices and thus react with surprise when the same person calls to them from two different locations in a short span of time. Saho Takagi and colleagues reached this conclusion by measuring cats’ levels of surprise based on their ear and head movements while the cats heard recordings of their owners’ voices from two speakers spaced far apart. Cats exhibited a low level of surprise when owners’ voices were played twice from the same speaker, but they showed a high level of surprise when the voice was played once each from the two different speakers. According to the text, how did the researchers determine the level of surprise displayed by the cats in the study?","A": "They watched how each cat moved its ears and head.","B": "They examined how each cat reacted to the voice of a stranger.","C": "They studied how each cat physically interacted with its owner.","D": "They tracked how each cat moved around the room.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it explains how the researchers determined the level of surprise displayed by the cats in the study. The text states that Saho Takagi and colleagues played recordings of the voice of each cat’s owner and measured how surprised the cat was by the recording based on how it moved its ears and head. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, the recordings played for each cat in the study were of the voice of the cat’s owner, not a stranger’s voice. Choice C is incorrect because the text explains that during the study, the cats didn’t interact directly with their owners; instead, the cats listened to recordings of their owners’ voices. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers monitored the cats’ movement around the room in which the study was conducted.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "016f25b0","Question": "“John of God, the Water-Carrier” is a 1913 short story by María Cristina Mena. In the story, the narrator presents John as being a hard worker who is fully dedicated to his job as water carrier, or aguador: ______ Which quotation from “John of God, the Water-Carrier” most effectively illustrates the claim?","A": "“Very happy, he would jog home, the heavy silver pieces in his leather pockets making a discreet and dulcet ‘trink-trak’ between his jugs and his body.”","B": "“He learned that the city aguador may not blow his whistle to halt the traﬃc while he gravely crosses the street, but must wait for the passing of many vehicles, some with horses and some outlandishly without.”","C": "“From early morn to the fall of the afternoon he would go from fountain to fountain and from portal to portal, his lean body so accustomed to bending that he never thought of straightening it, his head bowed as if in prayer.”","D": "“When his ﬁrst jugs had worn out—the sweet-scented, porous red clay becomes perforated in time—he had buried them to their necks in the corner where he slept, and they were now his treasury.”","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that John is hard-working and dedicated to his job. In the quotation, John is portrayed as spending “early morn to the fall of the afternoon” working hard as a water carrier. John is also described as “so accustomed to bending” while doing his work “that he never thought of straightening” his body, instead remaining deeply focused on his work. These details portray John as a dedicated worker. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation portrays John as happy about heading home after being paid. It doesn’t showcase John being hard at work. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t pertain to John’s commitment to his work; it describes diﬃculties the traﬃc in the city causes John in the performance of his work.

In the story, the author emphasizes that the setting where the character Valia is reading is nearly silent: ______ Which quotation from “Valia” most effectively illustrates the claim?","A": "“The hand in which he carried his book was getting stiff with cold, but he would not ask his mother to take the book from him.”","B": "“Valia was reading a huge, very huge book, almost half as large as himself.”","C": "“Valia approached the window and examined the toys.”","D": "“Everything in the room was quiet, so quiet that the only thing to be heard was the rustling of the pages he turned.”","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because this quotation most effectively illustrates the claim that the author emphasizes the near silence of the setting where the character Valia is reading. In the quotation, the author highlights the near silence of the setting by twice using the word “quiet” to describe the room. The author also calls attention to the fact that Valia is reading in a nearly silent setting by noting that the only sound to be heard is that of the pages being turned. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that Valia is in a chilly setting that causes his hand to become cold, not that he’s in a nearly silent setting. Choice B is incorrect because this quotation emphasizes the size of the book Valia is reading, not a quality of the setting where he’s reading it.

Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays and for other great occasions. According to the text, what is true about Mother?","A": "She wishes that more ladies would visit her.","B": "rthdays are her favorite special occasion.","C": "She creates stories and poems for her children.","D": "Reading to her children is her favorite activity.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it describes something that is true of Mother, as presented in the text. The text indicates that in addition to other activities, Mother writes stories for her children while they are at school and makes up “funny pieces of poetry” for certain occasions. Choice A is incorrect because the text suggests that Mother prefers to spend her time with her children and doesn’t sit at home hoping that ladies will visit her. Choice B is incorrect because the text says only that Mother makes up poetry for the children’s birthdays, not that she likes birthdays more than other special occasions.

Participants rated how congested it seemed before the obstacle, after the obstacle, and overall, and the researchers correlated those ratings with velocity and density. (Correlations range from −1 to 1, with greater distance from 0 indicating greater strength). The researchers concluded that the correlations with velocity are stronger than those with density. Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ conclusion?","A": "The correlation between congestion ratings before the obstacle and density is further from 0 than the correlation between overall congestion rating and velocity is.","B": "The correlation between congestion ratings before the obstacle and velocity is further from 0 than the correlation between congestion overall and velocity is.","C": "For each of the three ratings, the correlation with velocity is negative while the correlation with density is positive.","D": "For each of the three ratings, correlations with velocity are further from 0 than the corresponding correlations with density are.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the farther the correlation is from 0, the “stronger” it is (doesn’t matter if it’s negative or positive). The table shows that the correlations with velocity are farther from zero than the correlations with density, which supports the conclusion that the correlations with velocity are stronger. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. It makes an “apples to oranges” comparison by comparing density and velocity correlations across features instead of comparing them for each feature. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion. It doesn’t include the density correlations for comparison. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the conclusion.

The newsletter had an expansive reach for a publication of its kind: around 4,000 copies were published each month. A student writing a history paper, however, hypothesizes that Gidra’s inﬂuence cannot be measured by the number of newsletters published monthly alone. Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly support the student’s hypothesis?","A": "The students who initially formed Gidra each contributed ﬁnancially to its creation.","B": "In addition to covering current events, Gidra also featured works of art and literature.","C": "Gidra was initially based out of the Asian American Studies nter at UA.","D": "People would often give their copies of Gidra to others once they had ﬁnished reading an issue.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. If there were more Gidra readers than there were copies of the newsletter, then the newsletter’s inﬂuence would be much greater than its 4,000 monthly copies. Choice A is incorrect. Information about the newsletter’s initial funding doesn’t tell us about the inﬂuence that the newsletter eventually had. Choice B is incorrect. While the content of Gidra was undoubtedly related to the newsletter’s inﬂuence, this information isn’t relevant to the speciﬁc hypothesis about monthly circulation numbers. Choice C is incorrect.

To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of researchers constructed two battery-powered mechanical models of S. aegyptiacus, one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models to a series of identical tests in a water-ﬁlled tank. Which ﬁnding from the model tests, if true, would most strongly support Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis?","A": "The model with a sail took signiﬁcantly less time to complete a sharp turn while submerged than the model without a sail did.","B": "The model with a sail displaced signiﬁcantly more water while submerged than the model without a sail did.","C": "The model with a sail had signiﬁcantly less battery power remaining after completing the tests than the model without a sail did.","D": "The model with a sail took signiﬁcantly longer to travel a speciﬁed distance while submerged than the model without a sail did.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. This ﬁnding would most strongly support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. This ﬁnding suggests that the sail helped the dinosaur make sharp turns more quickly, which supports that hypothesis. Choice B is incorrect. This ﬁnding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the sail displacing more water would relate to that hypothesis —it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice C is incorrect. This ﬁnding wouldn’t necessarily support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail improved the dinosaur’s ability to chase quick, evasive prey. It’s unclear how the difference in battery power between the models would relate to that hypothesis—it doesn’t seem to be relevant. Choice D is incorrect.

In his ﬁrst major work, Arachne (1956), Hunt constructed the mythical character Arachne, a weaver who was changed into a spider, by welding bits of steel together into something that, although vaguely human, is strange and machine-like. And his large bronze sculpture The Light of Truth (2021) commemorates activist and journalist Ida B. Wells using mainly ﬂowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized ﬂame. Which choice best states the text’s main idea about Hunt?","A": "He often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style.","B": "He uses different kinds of materials depending on what kind of sculpture he plans to create.","C": "He tends to base his art on important historical ﬁgures rather than on ﬁctional characters.","D": "He has altered his approach to sculpture over time, and his works have become increasingly abstract.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, many of Richard Hunt’s sculptures “use broad forms rather than extreme accuracy”—in other words, they are more abstract than realistic. To illustrate Hunt’s abstract approach, the text characterizes his sculpture of Arachne as “vaguely human” and his work in honor of Ida B. Wells as “using mainly ﬂowing, curved pieces of metal that create stylized ﬂame.” Thus, the main idea is that Hunt often depicts the subjects of his sculptures using an unrealistic style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that one of Hunt’s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there is no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose the subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B. Wells is an important historical ﬁgure; Arachne is a “mythical character.” Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt’s style changed over time. In fact, although the two examples of Hunt’s work discussed in the text were created 65 years apart, they are both described as heavily stylized rather than realistic, which may suggest that some aspects of Hunt’s style haven’t changed over that time.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "082499f7","Question": "Hip-hop pedagogy is a form of teaching that’s gaining popularity across school subjects. It involves incorporating hip-hop and rap music into lessons as well as using hip-hop elements when teaching other subject matters. For example, Quan Neloms’s students look for college-level vocabulary and historical events in rap songs. Researchers claim that in addition to developing students’ social justice awareness, hip-hop pedagogy encourages student success by raising students’ interest and engagement. Which ﬁnding, if true, would most strongly support the underlined claim?","A": "Students tend to be more enthusiastic about rap music than they are about hip-hop music.","B": "Students who are highly interested in social justice issues typically don’t sign up for courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap music.","C": "Educators report that they enjoy teaching courses that involve hip-hop and rap music more than teaching courses that don’t.","D": "Courses that incorporate hip-hop and rap music are among the courses with the highest enrollment and attendance rates.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. Enrollment and attendance are logical ways to measure whether students are interested and engaged. High enrollment and attendance suggests a high level of interest and engagement. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. Students’ preferences between hip-hop and rap aren’t relevant to the claim, which is focused on whether or not students like classes that use hip-hop pedagogy (which includes the educational use of both hip-hop and rap). Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim. While the ﬁrst part of the sentence discusses social justice, the underlined claim focuses on student success, which is unrelated.

According to the text, Eugene Wigner hypothesized that a crystal could exist that would be composed of electrons and have a honeycomb-like shape. The text goes on to say that the existence of the Wigner crystal remained unconﬁrmed until Feng Wang and colleagues were able to make an impression of one using two semiconductors and an ultrathin sheet of graphene. Thus, the main idea is that researchers have obtained the most deﬁnitive evidence to date of the existence of the Wigner crystal. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on one kind of crystal—the Wigner crystal— and doesn’t discuss crystalline structures in general. And although the text conveys that Wang and colleagues ﬁgured out a way to capture an image of a Wigner crystal, it doesn’t address the idea of applying this approach to other types of crystals. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes in general the process Wang and colleagues followed to obtain an impression of the Wigner crystal; it doesn’t address the relative importance of each component in that process. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t state that researchers had a hard time getting an impression of the Wigner crystal because of its honeycomb structure.

By indicating that a collective didn’t continue because it was hard to share credit and responsibilities within the group even though the company was enjoyable, the quotation shows that working collaboratively can be diﬃcult for artists who are used to having complete control over their work. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation indicates that members of a collective are able to collaborate together and have agreed on a fair way to manage their responsibilities; this doesn’t demonstrate the challenge of sharing control among members of a collective.

The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions to working employees decrease energy and productivity levels. However, the text goes on to explain that a research team led by Harshad Puranik has found that there could be a social beneﬁt to these interruptions. Since the team found that workplace interruptions can increase employees’ sense of belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal beneﬁts of some interruptions can offset the perceived negative effects. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text presents research ﬁndings that suggest some workplace interruptions can have a positive effect on employee job satisfaction, no further information is presented to suggest at what frequency these interruptions are ideal. Furthermore, the text doesn’t tie workplace interruptions to increased productivity, but rather links it to social beneﬁts such as sense of belonging. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t address employees’ motives for choosing not to interrupt their colleagues. The text presents research ﬁndings that suggest that there are some positive interpersonal effects of workplace interruptions that can increase employee job satisfaction.

To reveal the effect of holding oﬃce, researchers must compare people who hold elected oﬃce with people who do not hold oﬃce but who are otherwise similar to the oﬃce-holders. Since researchers are unable to control which politicians win elections, they therefore ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "struggle to ﬁnd valid data about the behavior of politicians who do not currently hold oﬃce.","B": "can only conduct valid studies with people who have previously held oﬃce rather than people who presently hold oﬃce.","C": "should select a control group of people who differ from oﬃce holders in several signiﬁcant ways.","D": "will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the challenge researchers face when studying the effects of holding elected oﬃce on a person’s behavior. The text explains that it’s hard for researchers to test for the effects that elected oﬃce has on people because ﬁnding people to serve as a control group is diﬃcult. The text indicates that a control group needs to be made up of people who share characteristics of the group being tested but don’t have the variable being tested (in this case, holding elected oﬃce). Because researchers aren’t able to inﬂuence who wins elections, they’re also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn’t suggest that ﬁnding information about politicians’ behavior is diﬃcult. Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected oﬃce on a person’s behavior. Studying people who have already held elected oﬃce wouldn’t provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause. Choice C is incorrect because the text deﬁnes people in a control group as those “who are otherwise similar to the oﬃce-holders”; selecting people who differ from the oﬃce-holders wouldn’t ﬁt the criteria for an appropriate control group.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "196f220d","Question": "During the Bourbon Restoration in France (1814–1830), the right to vote required in part that a person paid at least 300 francs in direct taxes to the government. The four most common taxes (the quatre vieilles) were levied on real estate (both land and buildings); the doors and windows in taxpayer homes; the rental values of homes; and the businesses of artisans and merchants. (Foreign investments were either exempt from taxation or taxed lightly.) Although relatively few people paid the tax on real estate, it was the main means of voter qualiﬁcation and accounted for over two-thirds of government receipts during this period, suggesting that during the Bourbon Restoration ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "those people who had the right to vote most likely had substantial holdings of French real estate.","B": "the voting habits of French artisans and merchants were effective in reducing tax burdens on businesses.","C": "the number of doors and windows in French residences was kept to a minimum but increased after 1830.","D": "French people with signiﬁcant foreign investments were unlikely to have the right to vote.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. We’re told that people needed to pay “at least 300 francs in direct taxes” to be able to vote. We’re also told that, while “relatively few people paid the tax on real estate,” real estate taxes were both the main way people qualiﬁed to vote and the main source of revenue for the government. Based on this, we can infer that those who did qualify to vote likely had signiﬁcant French real estate holdings. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the voting habits of artisans and merchants nor any reduction in tax burdens on businesses, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although we know that doors and windows were taxed during the Bourbon Restoration, we don’t have enough information to infer if doors and windows increased after this time. Choice D is incorrect. Although we know that foreign investments were only minimally taxed, we don’t have enough information to determine if those with signiﬁcant foreign investments were unlikely to have voting rights. For example, it’s possible that those with signiﬁcant foreign investments were likely to also be people with signiﬁcant domestic investments which they did pay taxes on, so we don’t have the information necessary to make this inference.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "1a7e0ba2","Question": "Ana Castillo’s 1986 novel The Mixquiahuala Letters is a story told entirely through expressive letters from the narrator to her friend—letters that Castillo suggests could be read in several different orders.

According to the text, those students also found the novel’s treatment of gender to be old-fashioned. In response to the students’ concerns, their professor emphasized the novel’s relevance: it’s written in modern-sounding language and addresses issues that still matter. This, in turn, suggests that The Mixquiahuala Letters is more relevant to contemporary audiences than it may initially seem. Choice A is incorrect because the professor’s response to the students only mentions The Mixquiahuala Letters: it doesn’t compare the novel to others from the same period.

Researchers Jenna Ekwealor and Kirsten M. Fisher found several species of Syntrichia caninervis, a type of desert moss, growing under quartz crystals in California’s Mojave Desert. To evaluate whether these semitransparent rocks beneﬁted the moss, the researchers compared the shoot tissue, a measure of plant growth, of S. caninervis when growing on the soil surface versus when the moss was growing under the quartz rocks. They found that the shoot tissue was 62% longer for moss growing under the quartz as compared to moss on the soil surface, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "S. caninervis is one of the few types of moss that can survive under semitransparent rocks.","B": "quartz crystals do not transmit the necessary sunlight for photosynthesis in S. caninervis.","C": "S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture.","D": "quartz crystals are capable of supporting S. caninervis growth if the crystals are not too thin.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while desert moss species need suﬃcient sunlight for photosynthesis, exposure to sunlight can also affect the plants negatively by drying them out. Ekwealor and Fisher’s team found specimens of S. caninervis moss growing under quartz crystals that were semitransparent, allowing some but not all sunlight to pass through them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caninervis specimens found growing on the surface that were unprotected by such crystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an indicator of plant growth, and since greater exposure to sunlight results in greater loss of moisture, it can be inferred that S. caninervis growing under quartz crystals experience lower light intensity and are thus able to retain more moisture. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention another moss species besides S. caninervis or discuss whether other such species are able to grow under transparent crystals, as S. caninervis is. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text explains, specimens of S. caninervis were found growing under quartz crystals and exhibited more plant growth than specimens growing on the soil surface. This wouldn’t have been the case if the crystals transmitted insuﬃcient light for the moss’s photosynthesis. Choice D is incorrect. The text contrasts the growth of S. caninervis specimens found beneath semitransparent quartz crystals with that of specimens found on the soil surface absent such crystals, but it doesn’t make a comparison among specimens growing beneath crystals of different degrees of thickness or consider how the relative thickness of the crystals affects the growth of the moss.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "215af2f9","Question": "In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave’s ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as wide as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the signiﬁcance of the animal and humanoid ﬁgures adorning the cave.

In a study of sediment sampled at more than a dozen sites in Alpine streams, however, geologists Camille Litty and Fritz Schlunegger found that cross-site variations in grain size were not associated with differences in downstream distance, though they did not conclude that downstream distance is irrelevant to grain size. Rather, they concluded that sediment inﬂux in these streams may have been suﬃciently spatially diffuse to prevent the typical sorting effect from being observed.

The text explains that fan cells—a type of brain cell—are necessary for the acquisition of new associative memories, and that activity among these cells requires a chemical known as dopamine, which the brain produces in response to rewards. Since the brain cells that enable the formation of associative memories require dopamine in order to function, and since the brain produces dopamine in response to rewards, it can be inferred that receiving a reward should likely help to increase an individual’s capacity to form associative memories. Choice A is incorrect because the relationship between rewards and dopamine sketched by the text is that rewards result in the production of dopamine, not that they cause an individual’s capacity to utilize dopamine to decrease. Choice B is incorrect. The text suggests that receiving a reward would produce dopamine and thereby assist with associative memory formation. However, the text never suggests that associative memory involves the capacity to recognize differences between unrelated things, indicating only that associative memory involves remembering what connects those things.

To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals. What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?","A": "These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions.","B": "These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are.","C": "These corals have likely recovered from an environmental event without the assistance of algae colonies.","D": "These corals are more likely to survive without algae colonies than brown corals are.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The text says that corals produce bright colors to block sunlight and encourage algae to recolonize after “an environmental stressor.” From this, we can infer that corals that produce bright colors have probably been subjected to an environmental stressor. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that corals produce bright colors to block intense sunlight, which protects the light- sensitive algae that keep the coral healthy. In other words, bright colors make the coral’s health less vulnerable to intense sunlight. Choice C is incorrect.

Isla returned to Peru and used a drone to search a wide area, looking for the ﬁgure from the air. This approach suggests that Isla thought that if he hadn’t already seen it, the whalelike geoglyph ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "must represent a species of whale that went extinct before there were any people in Peru.","B": "is actually located in Germany, not Peru, and isn’t part of the Nazca Lines at all.","C": "is probably in a location Isla hadn’t ever come across while on the ground.","D": "was almost certainly created a long time after the other Nazca Lines geoglyphs were created.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelike geoglyph. The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Nazca Lines included a photograph showing a whalelike geoglyph that Isla hadn’t known about before attending the exhibit, even though Isla “specializes in” Nazca Lines geoglyphs. Given his expertise, and his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text strongly suggests that Isla believed he would have noticed the glyph if he had been to its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelike geoglyph is likely in a location Isla had not previously been to. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant to represent or its relationship to the earliest humans in the area that is now Peru. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the photograph of the whalelike geoglyph was on display at a “German exhibit,” that exhibit was speciﬁcally “about the Nazca Lines,” which the text indicates are located in Peru. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the glyphs were created “over a period of many centuries,” the text doesn’t address when in that period of time any particular glyphs were created.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "30f008d6","Question": "Some residents in a neighborhood in Atlanta recently founded a community garden inside a local park. The residents agreed to volunteer to take care of the garden together. Students at a local high school surveyed some of the volunteers as part of a project to understand the impact of the new garden. The students concluded that the new garden beneﬁted the community overall by fostering connections and relationships between the volunteers and other residents of the neighborhood who weren’t volunteering at the garden.

But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superﬁcial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, much of her music also reﬂects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre’s greatest songs, and they generally don’t require much digging to reveal. What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre?","A": "It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre’s songs.","B": "It evolved over time from a superﬁcial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns.","C": "It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres.","D": "It gave rise to a Black women’s musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. The text argues that disco is 'far less superﬁcial' than its popular perception might indicate, and that love and heartbreak are 'subjects hardly unique to disco.' Choice A is incorrect. This choice conﬂicts with the text, which says that scholars argue that disco 'is far less superﬁcial than many people believe.' Choice B is incorrect. This choice says the opposite of what the text suggests. The writer argues that the genre is not as superﬁcial as commonly believed, but that it always reﬂected 'concerns about community and identity.' Choice D is incorrect.

With each generation, small differences are introduced that result in distinct variations—called dialects—among geographically isolated populations of the same species. A research study examined whether twelve-day-old Ficedula hypoleuca (pied ﬂycatcher) nestlings prefer local dialects over the unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the more begging calls the nestlings made in response to a song, the stronger their preference. The researchers found that nestlings produced more begging calls in response to their own dialect than to nonlocal dialects. Since song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection, the ﬁnding suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "F. hypoleuca nestlings’ preference for their own dialect likely disappears as they mature to promote socialization between different F. hypoleuca populations.","B": "F. hypoleuca nestlings who show an early preference for their own dialect are likely to receive more food from their caretakers than nestlings who show no preferences among any F. hypoleuca dialects.","C": "F. hypoleuca nestlings’ preference for their own dialect likely drives them when they mature to reproduce with other F. hypoleuca from local rather than nonlocal populations.","D": "F. hypoleuca nestlings show a preference for both local F. hypoleuca dialects and the songs of other local songbirds over the songs of nonlocal birds of any species.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. Because “song preference plays a role in songbird mate selection,” and because F. hypoleuca nestlings display a preference for local dialects, we can infer that they will be more likely to choose mates from local populations. Choice A is incorrect. We don’t have any information suggesting that this preference disappears, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in response to various F. hypoleuca dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food received based on dialect preference.

Conventional ETL fabrication is accomplished using a solution of nanoparticles. The process can result in a loss of up to 80% of the solution, increasing the cost of manufacturing at scale—an issue that may be obviated by spray coating fabrication, which the researchers describe as “highly reproducible, concise, and practical.” What does the text most strongly suggest about conventional ETL fabrication?","A": "It is less suitable for manufacturing large volumes of planar p-i-n perovskite solar cells than an alternative fabrication method may be.","B": "It is more expensive when manufacturing at scale than are processes for fabricating ETLs used in other perovskite solar cell architectures.","C": "It typically entails a greater loss of nanoparticle solution than do other established approaches for ETL fabrication.","D": "It is somewhat imprecise and therefore limits the potential effectiveness of p-i-n planar perovskite solar cells at capturing and storing solar power.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. Conventional solar cell fabrication increases “the cost of manufacturing at scale,” but spray coating might get rid of that problem. Choice B is incorrect. This is not completely supported by the text. While it’s true that conventional ETL fabrication is expensive at scale, there’s nothing in the text that mentions other perovskite solar cell architectures. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not match the text. Only one conventional method of ETL fabrication is described, so we can’t compare the solution loss in this method to that of other conventional methods.

The text indicates that Mrs. Ochiltree makes comments about her acquaintances that are frank, or direct and blunt, and sometimes startling. It also states that because of this behavior, the acquaintances tend to avoid Mrs. Ochiltree. Together, these details suggest that the acquaintances choose not to be around Mrs. Ochiltree because they are offended by the things she has said about them. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mrs. Ochiltree’s acquaintances avoid discussing topics that would upset Mrs. Ochiltree; instead, it states that they avoid being around Mrs. Ochiltree at all. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes it clear that Mrs. Ochiltree knows her acquaintances often avoid her and is pleased about it (she “rather exulted in it”), not that she wants to spend more time with them.

In the quotation, Wheatley begs virtue to accompany her, or 'attend [her],' through her youth and to 'guide [her] steps to' the future goal of 'endless life and bliss.' Choice B is incorrect because this quotation suggests the diﬃculty of fully comprehending virtue. Rather than asking virtue for help, Wheatley presents it as a quality that is impossible to entirely understand because it is so grand and deep. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation describes Wheatley’s effort to comprehend virtue despite virtue itself declaring that such wisdom is beyond her grasp, or 'higher than a fool can reach.'

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "North erican gray wolves experience more outbreaks of distemper virus than other wolf species do.","B": "the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus.","C": "the average life span of gray wolves is likely to increase over time because of a particular gene variant.","D": "gray-furred wolves will soon replace black-furred wolves across North America.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The text tells us that the black-furred wolves are more common in areas with regular outbreaks of distemper virus and are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves. This suggests that the gene variant that results in black fur may be linked to immunity to the distemper virus. Choice A is incorrect. The text never compares North American gray wolves to other wolf species—in fact, it never discusses other wolf species at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The life span of gray wolves is never mentioned in this text, so we have no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text says that 'black-furred wolves are more likely to be immune to distemper than the gray-furred wolves,' but that alone doesn’t mean that black-furred wolves will replace gray-furred wolves across North America.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "4e21f987","Question": "The Post Oﬃce is a 1912 play by Rabindranath Tagore, originally written in Bengali.

That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk.”","C": "“I’ll pay when I grow up—before I leave to look for work out on the other side of that stream there.”","D": "“Wish I could be out too. Then I would pick some ﬂowers for you from the very topmost branches right out of sight.”","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that Amal imagines the people he sees are carefree even when engaged in work. In the quotation, Amal observes that the ﬂower seller’s daughter is “ﬂower gathering,” or working, as the text indicates. Moreover, Amal notes that the daughter’s feet “seem so glad” and her “anklets jingle so merrily,” suggesting that Amal believes that the ﬂower seller’s daughter is cheerful. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation makes no observation about the cheerful mood of the ﬂower seller’s daughter. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation discusses how Amal envisions his future, not the feelings of the ﬂower seller’s daughter.

The text begins by mentioning NASA’s Aspera mission, which will investigate the low-density gas that makes up the circumgalactic medium (CGM). According to the text, this mission will focus on a portion of the CGM’s gas that exists in a “warm-hot” phase; this “warm-hot” gas has not been previously observed, but it is thought to make up most of the mass of galaxies and play a part in star formation. Finally, the text mentions a telescope capable of examining this previously unobservable “warm-hot” gas: the Aspera mission will use this telescope in the hope of answering questions about galaxy formation and change. Therefore, the main idea of the text is that the Aspera mission is likely to produce the ﬁrst direct observations of CGM gas in the “warm- hot” phase, which likely has an important role in the evolution of galaxies.

One reason for Izquierdo’s relative obscurity is the enormous popularity of some of her peers. In particular, the painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have so captivated the interest of US audiences that Izquierdo and other Mexican artists from the period often get overlooked, despite the high quality of their work. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?","A": "Izquierdo’s work is not as well-known in the United States as it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw so much of the public’s attention.","B": "During Izquierdo’s lifetime, her paintings were displayed in galleries in the United States much more frequently than paintings by Kahlo and Rivera were.","C": "Izquierdo painted some of the same subjects that Kahlo and Rivera painted but used different techniques than they used.","D": "Few of Izquierdo’s works are in galleries today because she produced only a small number of paintings.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that María Izquierdo was an important ﬁgure in the history of twentieth-century Mexican art, but despite her importance, her work hasn’t received widespread recognition in the United States. According to the text, one reason for this is that Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera are so famous in the US that they overshadow other important Mexican artists, including Izquierdo. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Izquierdo’s work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Rivera draw most of the public’s attention. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the appearance of Izquierdo’s paintings in galleries in the US during her lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings were displayed more frequently than paintings by Kahlo or Rivera were. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Izquierdo has been overlooked in the US because of Kahlo’s and Rivera’s greater popularity. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss either the subject matter of Izquierdo’s paintings or the techniques she used, nor does it compare these aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo’s and Rivera’s paintings.

Du Bois. In the book, Du Bois suggests that upon hearing Black folk songs, he felt an intuitive and sometimes unexpected sense of cultural recognition: ______ Which quotation from The Souls of Black Folk most effectively illustrates the claim?","A": "“[Black folk music] still remains as the singular spiritual heritage of the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people.”","B": "“Ever since I was a child these songs have stirred me strangely. They came out of the South unknown to me, one by one, and yet at once I knew them as of me and of mine.”","C": "“ricature has sought again to spoil the quaint beauty of the music, and has ﬁlled the air with many debased melodies which vulgar ears scarce know from the real.

In the quotation, Du Bois explains that for his entire life, Black folk songs “stirred [him] strangely.” Even though they originated in the South, a region he wasn’t familiar with, he knew the songs “as of me and of mine.” That is, he identiﬁed strongly with them and associated them with his community. Therefore, Du Bois felt an intuitive sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. Choice A is incorrect. Although the quotation considers the cultural and spiritual value of Black folk music, it doesn’t establish that this music inspired in Du Bois a sense of cultural recognition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation addresses the cultural survival of Black folk songs despite attempts to caricature, or parody, them, not Du Bois’s sense of cultural connection to them.

The text tells us that because of the copyright, adapting Sherlock Holmes stories used to be expensive and diﬃcult. This suggests that after the copyright ends, it will be less expensive and less diﬃcult to adapt these stories. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that the copyright ending will make Sherlock Holmes stories harder to ﬁnd. Instead, it suggests that adaptations of these stories will be easier and less expensive to make. Choice B is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses people’s interest in detective stories, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

The passage tells us that the declaration was written in a language important to European diplomacy but not most Haitians, states that the declaration included 'a reassurance to the United States,' and made implicit references to colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declaration that were largely irrelevant to the Haitian people, we can assume that the Haitian people were not the only audience for this document. Choice A is incorrect. There’s no mention in the passage of similar documents in other countries, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice B is incorrect. Although there’s an implicit reference to European governments when the passage discusses how the declaration was written in French, 'which was used throughout Europe as the language of international diplomacy,' there is no discussion of the French government’s response to the declaration.

The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting “Bread!” or “Taxes!” and presents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor’s response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they’re shouting with “unanimity,” or total agreement. Clearly, this isn’t the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it’s not.

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren’t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated. Choice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn’t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts conﬁrmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn’t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts conﬁrmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn’t imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations.

The text indicates that scientists have long thought that giraffes produce little sound and exclusively rely on visual signals to communicate with one another. The text goes on to say, however, that Stöger and her team have recorded giraffes in three European zoos making a low- pitched humming sound, which the team claims the giraffes use to communicate when they cannot see each other. If the giraffes produced these sounds when visual communication was impossible and never produced them otherwise, that would support Stöger and her team’s claim about the circumstance in which giraffes make the sound. Choice A is incorrect because ﬁnding that giraffes have excellent vision and can see in color would have no bearing on Stöger and her team’s claim that giraffes produce a low-pitched humming noise to communicate when they cannot communicate visually. As presented in the text, Stöger and her team’s claim is restricted to circumstances in which giraffes cannot signal one another visually; if the giraffes are unable to signal visually, their sense of vision is irrelevant to their communication. Choice C is incorrect because ﬁnding that wild giraffes have never been recorded making humming noises would not support Stöger and her team’s claim about the function of the humming noise that the researchers recorded from the giraffes in European zoos. The text provides no information about whether researchers have even attempted to record low-pitched humming in wild giraffes, so nothing can be concluded about the implications of the lack of such recordings. Choice D is incorrect because ﬁnding that other animals in European zoos had been observed humming would not support Stöger and her team’s claim, since it would not indicate anything about why giraffes produce humming sounds. Different species could produce similar sounds for different purposes, so scientists could not conclude anything about the function of giraffe humming from a ﬁnding that some other animals in zoos also hum.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "5f5ebcd2","Question": "Roasted green chiles are a popular ingredient in Southwestern cuisine, but the traditional roasting method of burning propane is not environmentally friendly.

The team was successful in reaching the same roasting temperature used in traditional propane roasting, but they found that propane yielded faster results. While the fastest solar-roasted green chiles took six minutes, batches using propane took only four.

The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows ﬁnd and don’t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools—but not the tools without hooks—in their grasp or in safe places when they aren’t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it’s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren’t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they’re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren’t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools.

This suggests that burrowing crabs can either help or hurt marshes, depending on where they’re located. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses pannes of different sizes. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never suggests that crabs do more burrowing in the pannes (the areas with standing water) than they do at the edges. Rather, the text says that the burrowing that happens in the pannes is beneﬁcial, while the burrowing that happens at the edges is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported.

The text says that the formation at Mistaken Point contains fossils of “the earliest multicellular organisms,” which implies that these fossils are from an older time period than the fossils of “prehistoric human ancestors” found in the Minatogawa quarry. Choice A is incorrect. The text says that the formation at Mistake Point contains “more than 10,000 fossils,” but it doesn’t compare this number to the number of fossils in the Minatogawa quarry. It also doesn’t say anything about the variety of species in either formation. Choice B is incorrect.

She wanted audiences to feel like they were watching real people on screen. She would encourage actors in her ﬁlms to behave naturally. Guy-Blaché even hung a large sign reading “Be Natural” in the studio where she made her ﬁlms. At the time, ﬁlms lacked sound, so actors needed to rely solely on their bodies and facial expressions to convey emotions. As a result, actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions. The style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s ﬁlms was therefore ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "copied by many of Guy-Blaché’s peers.","B": "familiar to actors who had worked on other directors’ ﬁlms.","C": "very unusual for the period.","D": "better than ﬁlm acting today.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that “actors tended to highly exaggerate their actions and expressions” in ﬁlms produced from 1896 to 1920. This suggests that the natural style of acting in Guy-Blaché’s ﬁlms was very unusual for the time. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses any other directors copying the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s ﬁlms, and in fact suggests the opposite—that it was unusual for directors to suggest this style of acting at the time. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses actors’ familiarity with the style of acting found in Guy-Blaché’s ﬁlms, so there isn’t much basis for this inference. But since the text tells us that other ﬁlms of the period used a highly exaggerated form of acting, we might predict that the natural style in Guy-Blachés ﬁlms would have been unfamiliar to these actors.

Such identiﬁcation is heightened by “invisible editing,” or editing so inconspicuous that it renders cuts between shots almost unnoticeable. Conversely, Mulvey proposes that conspicuous editing or an absence of point-of-view shots would induce a more critical stance toward a protagonist. Consider, for example, the attic scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, a conspicuously edited sequence of tens of shots, few of which correspond to the protagonist’s point of view. According to Mulvey’s logic, this scene should affect viewers by ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "obscuring their awareness of the high degree of artiﬁce involved in constructing the montage.","B": "lessening their identiﬁcation with the protagonist, if not alienating them from the character altogether.","C": "compelling them to identify with the ﬁlm’s director, whose proxy is the camera, and not with the protagonist.","D": "diverting their attention away from the ﬁlm’s content and toward its stylistic attributes.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. We’re told that point-of-view shots and “invisible editing” make audiences identify with a character. We’re also told that obvious editing and a lack of point-of-view shots have the opposite effect. Since the sequence in The Birds falls into this second category, it should have the effect of reducing the audience’s connection with the protagonist. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention viewers’ awareness of artiﬁce (i.e., camera trickery) in ﬁlms, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention the director at all, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect.

Historian Ashley D. Farmer has shown that expanding the array of primary sources to encompass more types of print material—including political cartoons, advertisements, and artwork—leads to a much better understanding of the movement and the crucial and diverse roles that Black women played in shaping it.

It best describes the main idea of the text. The text starts by saying that historians of the Black Power movement are too reliant on openly ideological works, which were written mostly by men, as sources. The text then describes Farmer’s research: she has shown that including other kinds of sources leads to a better understanding of the Black Power movement and the role Black women played in it. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the main idea of the text. In fact, it conﬂicts with the text. The text says that historians have relied on 'essays and other explicitly ideological works,' which suggests that they have studied at least some of the intellectual dimensions of the Black Power movement. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the main idea of the text. The text never mentions how other historians of the Black Power movement view Farmer’s use of unconventional sources.

Although many believe that only modern humans developed systems for notating numbers, one archaeologist asserts that this artifact may be a sign that Neanderthals also recorded numerical information. The notches on the bone are unevenly spaced but approximately parallel, and microscopic analysis reveals that they were made with a single stone tool; according to the archaeologist, this suggests that the notches were all made at one time by one individual as a means of counting something. Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly weaken the underlined claim?","A": "Parallel lines are a common feature in modern humans’ early systems for recording numerical information.","B": "More than nine approximately parallel notches made with a different stone tool are present on another artifact found at a site in western France.","C": "It would have taken careful effort to make evenly spaced lines on bone with the stone tools typically used by Neanderthals.","D": "corative art discovered at another Neanderthal site in western France primarily features patterns of unevenly spaced parallel lines.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The archeologist bases their claim on the fact that the hyena bone features unevenly spaced parallel notches. But if unevenly spaced parallel lines were found on 'decorative art' at another Neanderthal site, it would suggest that the hyena bone is probably decorative art as well—not a counting tool. Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually strengthen the claim: assuming we can make an inference about Neanderthals using a fact about early humans, it provides more support for the idea that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim. The fact that another artifact had parallel notches made with a different stone tool doesn’t tell us anything about the use of either artifact. For all we know, they could both have been used for counting. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t weaken the underlined claim.

This quotation argues that Lumumba “warrants” (or deserves) “scholarly attention” as a symbol and not for his “practical accomplishments”—that is, his actions as prime minister—which “can be passed over quickly,” or dismissed as being of comparatively little importance. Thus, the quotation expresses the view that the student criticizes some historians for holding. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation touches on the diﬃculty of evaluating Lumumba’s legacy, it doesn’t address how historians of modern African politics view him as a symbol. Choice B is incorrect.

The fact that a cupid is shown near the female ﬁgure, therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "is not conclusive evidence that the ﬁgure is Venus.","B": "suggests that Venus was often depicted ﬁshing.","C": "eliminates the possibility that the ﬁgure is Venus.","D": "would be diﬃcult to account for if the ﬁgure is not Venus.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion about the signiﬁcance of the cupid found at Pompeii. The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female ﬁgure who is ﬁshing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female ﬁgure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of ﬁshing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female ﬁgure engaged in ﬁshing does not indicate with certainty that the ﬁgure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with ﬁshing, and the ﬁgure might be anyone at all). Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted ﬁshing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female ﬁgure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain’s proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female ﬁgure, and so the possibility that the ﬁgure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be deﬁnitively eliminated.

As a result, the Sumerians ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "harvested crops only on the hottest days of each season.","B": "found ways to shield their crops from the sun.","C": "did not begin farming until long after 4000 B.","D": "were able to store extra crops for later use.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sumerian civilization and crop growth. The text mentions the hot, sunny weather in the area where the Sumerians lived, which made crops grow quickly but also made it diﬃcult to keep them alive. The Sumerians solved this problem by using river water for their farming—as a result, they often harvested more crops than were needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must have needed to ﬁnd something to do with the surplus crops—that is, they stored the extra crops for later use. Choice A is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that a surplus in crops would lead the Sumerians to choose only certain days of the season to harvest. Nor is there any indication in the text that the Sumerians improved their farming methods with the goal of reducing the time spent farming. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the Sumerians tried to shield their crops from the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped crops grow very quickly and that the Sumerians used river water to allow crops to be exposed to the sun without dying. Choice C is incorrect. Having a surplus of crops wouldn’t have caused the Sumerians to begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian civilization formed around 4000 BCE and farming was a part of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming long after 4000 BCE isn’t supported by the text.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "74d7088a","Question": "The following text is adapted from María Cristina Mena’s 1914 short story “The Vine-Leaf.” It is a saying in the capital of Mexico that Dr. Malsufrido carries more family secrets under his hat than any archbishop.

The text establishes that using chemical herbicides to control leafy spurge in North America can also harm other plants nearby. The text then indicates that it might be possible to use engineered DNA to prevent plants from reproducing, which would be useful for “exclusively targeting” leafy spurge. If it’s possible to exclusively target leafy spurge with engineered DNA—meaning that only leafy spurge is affected by the engineered DNA—and prevent the plant from reproducing, then leafy spurge numbers could be reduced “without harming other organisms.” Choice A is incorrect because the text raises the possibility of using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing, not to make individual leafy spurge plants more vulnerable to chemical herbicides that already exist.

Heliographs were used for rapid communication across expansive distances for military, surveying, and forestry purposes during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but they were largely effective only during the daytime, and the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight. Therefore, heliographs were eventually replaced by technology that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "worked on similar principles but was easier to produce and maintain.","B": "was not so constrained by environmental circumstances.","C": "could be used for more than military, surveying, or forestry purposes.","D": "enabled communication that didn’t require knowledge of Morse code.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The passage explains that heliographs “were largely effective only during the daytime” and that “the range of the device depended on factors such as the opacity of the air and line of sight.” These constraints would have greatly limited the use of the heliograph, so we can infer that this would have been a reason to replace it with new technology. Choice A is incorrect. The passage doesn’t discuss the production and maintenance of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention any “other purposes” that a heliograph wouldn’t work for, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice D is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention knowledge of Morse code as a particular problem with the use of heliographs, so there’s no basis for this inference.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "7c098071","Question": "Barchester Towers is an 1857 novel by Anthony Trollope. In the novel, Trollope’s portrayal of Dr. Proudie underscores the character’s exaggerated sense of his own abilities: ______ Which quotation from Barchester Towers most effectively illustrates the claim?","A": "“It must not…be taken as proved that Dr. Proudie was a man of great mental powers, or even of much capacity for business, for such qualities had not been required in him.”","B": "“[Dr. Proudie] was comparatively young, and had, as he fondly ﬂattered himself, been selected as possessing such gifts, natural and acquired, as must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.”","C": "“[Dr. Proudie’s] residence in the metropolis, rendered necessary by duties thus entrusted to him, his high connexions, and the peculiar talents and nature of the man, recommended him to persons in power.”","D": "“[. Proudie] was certainly possessed of suﬃcient tact to answer the purpose for which he was required without making himself troublesome.”","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. In this quotation, Dr. Proudie is described as 'fondly ﬂatter[ing] himself' that he has gifts that 'must be sure to recommend him to a yet higher notice.' In other words, he expects his skills to push him to greater fame and success. This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support. Choice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially ﬂattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not 'proved,' it implies that he is actually dim- witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect.

The claim we’re trying to prove is that guilds were much more numerous relative to population in some cities than others. This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and Paris), showing signiﬁcant differences between guilds relative to population in these cities. Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Bordeaux had 80,000 inhabitants, according to the table, while Lyon had 143,000, so it isn’t correct to say that they had 'nearly equal numbers of inhabitants.' Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Although Lyon did have fewer inhabitants than Paris, it didn’t have more guilds—Paris had 133 guilds versus Lyon’s 72. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t support the claim.

Performance scholar Susan Manning observes that many choreographers, like playwrights and musical theater writers, are concerned with storytelling and characterization. In fact, some choreographers describe the dances they create as expressions of narrative through movement; it is therefore unsurprising that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "dramaturges can have a profound impact on the artistic direction of plays and musicals.","B": "choreographers developing dances with narrative elements frequently engage dramaturges to assist in reﬁning those elements.","C": "dances by choreographers who incorporate narrative elements are more accessible to audiences than dances by choreographers who do not.","D": "some directors and actors rely too heavily on dramaturges to complete certain research tasks.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. Dramaturges help playwrights with storytelling and characterization. Choreographers often tell stories through dance, so they are also concerned with storytelling and characterization. This suggests that the fact that choreographers seek the help of dramaturges with the storytelling aspects of their dances should be “unsurprising.” Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is leading to a conclusion about how choreographers use dramaturges. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never mentions dances by choreographers who don’t incorporate narrative elements. Choice D is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text mentions in passing that directors use dramaturges to conduct research, but it never suggests that directors and actors are too reliant on them.

Meanwhile, only 6% of the youths said that they think volunteering is a way to help ﬁx problems in society overall. These replies suggest that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "many young people think they can volunteer only within their own communities.","B": "volunteering may be even more helpful than many young people think it is.","C": "volunteering can help society overall more than it can help individual people.","D": "many young people may not know how to ﬁnd ways to volunteer their time.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of volunteering. The text asserts that volunteering beneﬁts both the community in which one volunteers and society as a whole. It then states that in a survey of young people, a majority of respondents said that volunteering helps individuals, but only 6% of respondents said that volunteering helps society as a whole. If volunteering does in fact help society as a whole, as the text says, but only 6% of young people believe it does, then it’s reasonable to conclude that volunteering is more helpful than many young people think it is. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses young people’s beliefs about the beneﬁts of volunteering, not where young people believe they are able to volunteer. Nothing in the text suggests that many young people believe they are only able to volunteer in their own communities. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that volunteering is beneﬁcial for society as a whole, nothing in the text suggests that volunteering can beneﬁt society more than it can beneﬁt individual people. The text doesn’t compare the beneﬁts to society with the beneﬁts to individuals.

In their investigations of Arabia Terra, the researchers found remnants of ash deposits in an amount and thickness that would result from a massive volcanic eruption. However, erosion and past resurfacing events could have modiﬁed the surface of the planet. Therefore, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "the current makeup of the abia Terra region might not accurately reﬂect the volcanic activity of Mars’s past.","B": "eruptions from Mars’s volcanoes were likely not as massive as astronomers previously believed.","C": "ash was most likely expelled from multiple different volcanoes on Mars’s surface.","D": "the craters found in the Arabia Terra region were necessarily created by events other than volcanic eruptions.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the Arabia Terra region of Mars. According to the text, there are craters in Arabia Terra that could be the result of volcanic activity, and researchers have found evidence of ash deposits consistent with a large eruption. The text goes on to note, however, that erosion and other events could have altered the surface of Mars. This observation suggests that current conditions on Mars’s surface are not necessarily a reliable guide to past events—some signs of past events could have been transformed or erased entirely—and thus the current makeup of Arabia Terra may not accurately reﬂect past volcanic activity. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests only that past events could have changed Mars’s surface such that its current appearance isn’t a reliable guide to past activity, not that it’s likely that past eruptions were not as massive as astronomers previously believed. Nothing in the text supports a conclusion about the likely size of past eruptions. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that resurfacing events could have changed the appearance of Mars doesn’t imply that the ash discussed in the text likely came from multiple volcanoes. Although it’s possible that the ash came from different volcanoes, there’s no information in the text supporting a conclusion about how likely that possibility is. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Arabia Terra craters had to have been created by something other than volcanic eruptions. Although the text does suggest that the evidence consistent with volcanic eruptions shouldn’t be taken as deﬁnitive proof of past eruptions, that doesn’t mean that the craters couldn’t have been created by eruptions, only that we can’t be certain they were.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "80f34f4d","Question": "A team of biologists led by Jae-Hoon Jung, Antonio D.

A comparison of unmodiﬁed A. thaliana plants with the altered plants showed no difference in ﬂowering at 22° Celsius, but at 27° Celsius, the unmodiﬁed plants exhibited accelerated ﬂowering while the altered ones did not, which suggests that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "temperature-sensitive accelerated ﬂowering is unique to thaliana.","B": "A. thaliana increases ELF3 production as temperatures rise.","C": "ELF3 enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures.","D": "temperatures of at least 22° Celsius are required for A. thaliana to ﬂower.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of accelerated ﬂowering in A. thaliana plants. The text indicates that A. thaliana plants show accelerated ﬂowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated ﬂowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of A. thaliana plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn’t show accelerated ﬂowering. The team then compared these modiﬁed plants to A. thaliana plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in ﬂowering at 22° Celsius, but at 27° Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated ﬂowering while the plants without ELF3 didn’t. If accelerated ﬂowering at the higher temperature occurred in the A. thaliana plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive ﬂowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of ﬂowering is unique to A. thaliana. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the ﬂowering of modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed A. thaliana plants at 22° Celsius, there’s no suggestion that A. thaliana only begins to ﬂower at 22° Celsius; the text doesn’t mention a speciﬁc temperature threshold required for A. thaliana ﬂowering.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "81e00e23","Question": "Accomplished printmaker and sculptor Elizabeth Catlett (1915–2012) used her art to explore the Black experience in the United States.

The quotation explains that to create the work, Catlett combined Indigenous sculpture with the visual aesthetic of modern muralists from Mexico as well as that of German artist Kathe Kollwitz. In other words, Catlett was able to unify several artistic traditions and styles within a single sculpture. Choice B is incorrect because in discussing the technique and subject matter of Catlett’s collage, the quotation makes no reference to particular traditions or styles. Choice C is incorrect because in describing the sculpture, the quotation doesn’t mention any artistic traditions or styles that Catlett may have synthesized to create the work.

The narrator of the text says that when Dorian sees his portrait, “his cheeks ﬂushed for a moment with pleasure” and “a look of joy came into his eyes.” The narrator goes on to say that Dorian looked at the portrait “in wonder” and presents him as being so entranced by the portrait that he doesn’t notice what Hallward is saying to him. All these details support the description of Dorian as being delighted by what he sees in the portrait. Choice A is incorrect because Dorian isn’t depicted as interested in Hallward’s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by the painting that he’s hardly even aware of Hallward. Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is mentioned in the text, so there’s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings. Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there’s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings.

The text says that the cerebellum has long been thought to regulate motor functioning, but new research shows that it may also have other functions—including regulating emotion and social behavior and some connection to motivation and rewards processing. Choice A is incorrect. The VTA is described as “a center for motivation and reward processing,” and the discovery of the pathway between the VTA and the cerebellum supports the theory that the cerebellum is involved in functions other than motor coordination. Choice B is incorrect. The text says that recent research has identiﬁed this pathway, but it doesn’t discuss any previous “widely accepted claims” about the pathway’s function.

Ah, that is how a man should be!”","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim in the text that Hedda seeks to inﬂuence another character’s fate. In the quotation, Hedda says that she wants “to have power to mould a human destiny,” or shape a person’s fate, just as the text indicates. Additionally, the phrase “for once in my life” suggests that Hedda feels that she has never been able to shape anyone’s life, including her own, supporting the text’s assertion that she “is unable to freely determine her own future.” Choice A is incorrect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncertain about what to do with her own life, not wanting to inﬂuence another person’s fate. Choice C is incorrect because while this quotation shows Hedda’s interest in ﬁnding out whether she has any power over another character, it doesn’t clearly show that she wants to inﬂuence that person’s fate.

However, he ironically suggests that this deﬁnition excludes mercy and forgiveness—qualities that are also thought of as virtues; according to him, Lady Chiltern is “pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.” This description supports the idea that Lady Chiltern is perceived by others as virtuous as well as unforgiving. Choice A is incorrect. The quotation supports the claim that Lady Chiltern is perceived as virtuous, in that it describes her as “a woman of the very highest principles.” However, it doesn’t characterize her as unforgiving or being perceived as such. Choice B is incorrect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with morality, but it suggests that her interest in discussing it is fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means by which to judge others. However, the quotation doesn’t address the question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmerciful to those who seek forgiveness for harm they have caused.

Planes travel faster than trains, but air travel typically requires 3 hours of lead time for security, baggage handling, and boarding that rail travel doesn’t, so short- haul routes take similar amounts of time by air and by rail. However, the model suggests that as rail passenger volumes approach current capacity limits, long lead times emerge. Therefore, for rail to remain a viable alternative to short-haul ﬂights, ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "rail systems should offer fewer long-haul routes and airlines should offer more long-haul routes.","B": "rail systems may need to schedule additional trains for these routes.","C": "security, baggage handling, and boarding procedures used by airlines may need to be implemented for rail systems.","D": "passengers who travel by rail for these routes will need to accept that lead times will be similar to those for air travel.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. Air travel usually requires much more “lead time” than train travel, so short ﬂights end up taking the same amount of time as a train trip to the same destination. But train travel starts to need more “lead time” when the trains approach their capacity limits. This suggests that train companies should add more trains for these routes if they want to encourage travelers to take a train instead of a plane. Choice A is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text never discusses “long-haul routes” for either air travel or rail travel, so there is no basis to make this inference. Choice C is incorrect. This inference isn’t supported. The text only mentions these procedures to explain why the “lead time” is so long for air travel.

Which ﬁnding about mbaqanga and quan họ, if true, would most directly support Zheng’s claim?","A": "Mbaqanga and quan họ developed independently of each other and have little in common musically.","B": "Mbaqanga is signiﬁcantly more popular in the English-speaking world than quan họ is.","C": "Mbaqanga and quan họ are now performed by a diverse array of musicians with no direct connections to South Africa or Vietnam.","D": "Mbaqanga and quan họ are highly distinct from British and North American popular music genres but similar to each other.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. Zheng’s claim is that the idea of world music “homogenizes” (meaning makes similar) distinct kinds of music by reducing them to one category. In other words, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful oversimpliﬁcation of diverse musical forms. To support this claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. If it’s true that mbaqanga and quan họ developed separately and have little in common musically, then it wouldn’t make sense to lump them into the same category. Choice B is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from one another that they should not fall into the same category. A difference in popularity doesn’t necessarily mean that the two musical traditions shouldn’t be categorized together: instead, we need to know if the music itself is similar or different. Choice C is incorrect. If true, this wouldn’t affect the claim. To support the claim, we need evidence that these musical traditions are so different from each other that they should not fall into the same category. This choice doesn’t do that. Choice D is incorrect. If true, this would actually weaken the claim. Zheng thinks it’s reductive or oversimplifying to put distinct musical traditions into a single category. But if mbaqanga and quan họ are similar to each other, then it would make sense to put them in the same category.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "96b04be5","Question": "The following text is adapted from Edgar Allan Poe’s 1849 story “Landor’s Cottage.” During a pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing.

Because Mars’s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth’s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For ﬁve years, Quon’s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars’s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can ﬂy on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth. According to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to ﬂy on Mars?","A": "Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions","B": "cause the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars","C": "Because the gravity of Mars is much weaker than the gravity of Earth","D": "Because helicopters built for Earth are too small to handle the conditions on Mars","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars’s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn’t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can’t ﬂy on Mars because of the differences in the two planets’ atmospheres. Choice B is incorrect because instead of stating that the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars, the text indicates that the helicopter built to ﬂy on Mars actually has even longer blades than a helicopter built for Earth. Choice C is incorrect because the text never addresses the role of gravity on Mars or on Earth; instead, it focuses on atmospheric conditions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that helicopters built for Earth are too small to operate in the conditions on Mars.

The text describes how Barve found an association between habitat temperature and feather structure among Himalayan songbirds, which supports the general prediction that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice A is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to contradict previous predictions. In fact, the study supports the prediction described in the ﬁrst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature. Choice C is incorrect. Barve’s study isn’t said to “complicate an earlier hypothesis.” In fact, the study supports the earlier prediction described in the ﬁrst sentence, which is that birds’ feather structures vary with habitat temperature.

In the quotation, Alexandra is described as enjoying looking at the stars and feeling a “sense of personal security” when she contemplates nature’s order and its governing laws. This suggests that Alexandra takes comfort in understanding the world around her. Choice A is incorrect because the quotation expresses how Alexandra Bergson attempts to meet diﬃcult situations with determination, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation expresses “how much the country meant to” Alexandra Bergson, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her.

The text compares the needs of a “fragile and lovely ﬂower” to those of the speaker’s “tender mind”: both need to be fed if they’re going to survive. Without such feeding, they’ll “beginneth straightway to languish,” or weaken. Thus, the text suggests that the human mind is like a ﬂower in that they both need proper nourishment in order to thrive. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the passage of time or describe either the human mind or a ﬂower as becoming increasingly vigorous. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that human minds or ﬂowers draw strength from changes in weather. The references to rain in the text pertain to a ﬂower’s need for water rather than the general effects of changing weather.

The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reﬂects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene. Choice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines—the waves—isn’t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose. Choice D is incorrect.

The text goes on to say that although technological changes have altered jalis’ role somewhat, jalis are still valued for preserving the histories of their communities. Choice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about jalis’ views of the various tasks they perform. There is no information to support the idea that many jalis prefer teaching to other tasks. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe jalis as being sources of entertainment. Rather, jalis are presented as valued sources of knowledge. Additionally, the text gives no indication of how long jalis have been serving their communities.

The text tells us that “people who got to touch the items were willing to pay much more money for them than people who weren’t allowed to touch” them. This suggests that being able to interact with a product in person may make it seem more valuable to a shopper. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss how much people spend each month, so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, since being able to touch a product tends to make people “willing to pay much more money” for it, we might predict that an online shopper would be willing to spend less on the same purchases as an in-person shopper. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t discuss what retailers “should charge,” so there’s not much basis for this claim. Furthermore, the study in the text suggests that in-person stores may actually be able to charge more for a given product, since shoppers can touch it. Choice D is incorrect.

The text describes a student advancing the claim that Chambi’s photographs “have considerable ethnographic value”— meaning that they are valuable as records of cultures—and that they “capture diverse elements of Peruvian society” in a respectful way. If it’s true that Chambi carefully photographed people from a range of different communities in Peru as well as photographed the customs and sites of different communities, that would lend support to the claim that the photographs have ethnographic value as depictions of diverse elements of society in Peru. Choice B is incorrect because the student’s claim is that Chambi’s photographs have considerable ethnographic value because they depict diverse elements of Peruvian society; the student doesn’t claim anything about the technical skill demonstrated in the photographs. Choice C is incorrect because neither Chambi’s reputation nor the locations where his photographs may have been published would be relevant to the student’s claim that his photographs are valuable as an ethnographic record of Peru’s diverse society.

In humans, they are functionally important within the hippocampus, a brain structure that supports complex cognitive processes. When the results of molecular analysis of two species of octopus—an animal known for its intelligence—were announced in 2022, the conﬁrmation of a LINE transposon in Octopus vulgaris and Octopus bimaculoides genomes prompted researchers to hypothesize that that transposon family is tied to a species’ capacity for advanced cognition.

Three of the moons have prograde orbits (orbiting in the direction the planet spins), and the other 17 have retrograde orbits (orbiting in the opposite direction of the planet’s spin). All but one of the 20 moons are thought to be remnants of bodies that orbited Saturn until they broke apart in collisions. Although the one exceptional moon orbits in the same direction as the planet’s spin, its orbit is highly eccentric compared to the rest, which may suggest that it has a different origin than the other 19 moons.

The text indicates that three of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the planet’s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but were broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the exceptional moon’s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon’s orbit is so eccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same origin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it’s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn’t have a retrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon’s origin is that it may be different than the origin of the other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet’s spin, meaning that the moon’s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde.

According to the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the behavior evolved from an ancestor that mostly stayed on the ground and walked on four limbs, as modern chimpanzees and gorillas do. However, the ﬁnding that orangutans, also a relative of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in trees while using their arms to balance and reach for fruits suggests another possible explanation: perhaps a tree-dwelling ancestor of humans began moving on two legs because it offered an advantage, such as access to certain foods. Choice B is incorrect because the ﬁnding that modern orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into when either bipedalism or tree-climbing behavior emerged in human ancestors. Additionally, the text indicates that one theory is that bipedalism evolved from a mostly ground-based ancestor that was already practicing knuckle-walking, not that bipedalism and knuckle-walking developed at the same time. Choice C is incorrect because the ﬁnding that orangutans (a relative of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in trees doesn’t offer any insight into how diﬃcult it would’ve been to move between the ground and the trees without bipedalism; there’s no suggestion that climbing or moving in trees depends on the ability to walk on two legs rather than four, even if that ability might be helpful in certain circumstances.

The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own. Choice A is incorrect because Allen’s claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions more easily understood by any particular group of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen’s claim that judicial opinions could be strengthened by the inclusion of discussions of philosophers whose views disagree with those of the judges authoring the opinions. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents Allen’s argument that discussing philosophers whose views judges disagree with could strengthen judicial opinions, not that doing so could bring those opinions into line with views that are popular among philosophers.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "c5afa333","Question": "Culinary anthropologist Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor may be known for her decades of work in national public television and radio, but her book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is likely her most inﬂuential project. The 1970 book, whose title refers to Smart-Grosvenor’s roots in the Low Country of South Carolina, was unusual for its time. It combined memoir, recipes, travel writing, and social commentary and challenged notions about conventions of food and cooking. Long admired by many, the book and its author have shaped contemporary approaches to writing about cuisine. Which choice best describes the main idea of the text?","A": "Smart-Grosvenor’s unconventional book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is an important contribution to food writing.","B": "Smart-Grosvenor held many different positions over her life, including reporter and food writer.","C": "Smart-Grosvenor’s groundbreaking book Vibration oking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl didn’t receive the praise it deserved when it was ﬁrst published in 1970.","D": "Smart-Grosvenor was a talented chef whose work inspired many people to start cooking for themselves.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text.

This plant fossil included a ﬂower bud, which the researchers believe provides evidence that ﬂowering plants emerged in the Jurassic period, which falls between 145 million and 201 million years ago. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that Wang and colleagues discovered a 164-million-year-old ﬂowering plant fossil in China, not one that is 150 million years old. Although 150 million years ago would fall within the Jurassic period, according to the text it isn’t the age of the discovered fossil.

Most notably, the New Mexican dialect retains older features of the language that other dialects lost in later centuries. But why would it have done so? New Mexico was so distant from population centers in Spain’s other colonies that it attracted few colonists after its initial colonization. Geographical isolation in turn would have limited the exposure of New Mexican colonists to changes occurring to Spanish grammar and vocabulary elsewhere in the empire. Thus, the present-day uniqueness of the New Mexican dialect suggests the extent to which ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "a language can protect itself from being inﬂuenced by other languages.","B": "the grammar and vocabulary of any given language change from one generation to the next.","C": "geographical isolation can inﬂuence how a language develops.","D": "speakers of one dialect of a language can understand speakers of another dialect of that language.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spoken in New Mexico, which was colonized by Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain’s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony’s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geographical isolation can inﬂuence how a language develops. Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses different dialects of Spanish, not different languages altogether. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has stayed the same over time in some ways, not on how it has changed from one generation to the next. Choice D is incorrect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican dialect of Spanish is different from others, it does not discuss how speakers of different dialects are able to understand each other.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "c7502ac8","Question": "“Odalie” is an 1899 short story by Alice Dunbar-Nelson.

Dunbar-Nelson portrays Odalie as eager to escape the monotony of her everyday life: ______ Which quotation from “Odalie” most effectively illustrates the claim?","A": "“Mardi Gras was a tiresome day, after all, she sighed, and Tante Louise agreed with her for once.”","B": "“In the old French house on Royal Street, with its quaint windows and Spanish courtyard green and cool, and made musical by the plashing of the fountain and the trill of caged birds, lived Odalie in convent-like seclusion.”","C": "“When one is shut up in a great French house with a grim sleepy tante and no companions of one’s own age, life becomes a dull thing, and one is ready for any new sensation.”","D": "“It was Mardi Gras day at last, and early through her window Odalie could hear the jingle of folly bells on the [participants’] costumes, the tinkle of music, and the echoing strains of songs.”","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from “Odalie” to illustrate the claim that Odalie is eager to escape the monotony, or tedious lack of variety, of her everyday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes feeling “shut up” and complains that she has “no companions” except for her “sleepy tante.” Odalie goes on to say that, as a result, her life is “dull” and she is “ready for any new sensation,” meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes to get away from her monotonous everyday life. Choice A is incorrect. Although this quotation includes the word “tiresome,” which means dull, it does so to suggest Odalie’s negative feelings about Mardi Gras, which is a once-a-year celebration, not her feelings about her everyday life. This quotation therefore doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation ends by saying that Odalie lives in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn’t express that Odalie’s everyday life is monotonous or that she wishes to escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie lives in, saying that it has “quaint windows” and a “green and cool” courtyard that is “made musical” by the sounds of a fountain and pet birds.

What is intriguing is that bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty do not contain this form of lead, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "Shang dynasty bronze pieces are rare and therefore more valuable than those from other time periods.","B": "the source of some of the raw materials used to make bronze was exploited only until the end of the Shang dynasty.","C": "bronze was used for a short time during the Shang dynasty before different metals were used to make artifacts.","D": "methods used to analyze bronze artifacts are not useful on pieces that are dated after the Shang dynasty.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The passage tells us that Shang dynasty bronze artifacts contained 'a rare form of lead,' but that bronze artifacts after this time did not contain that lead. Although we don’t know where that speciﬁc type of bronze came from, we can conclude that that source was not used after the end of the Shang dynasty—otherwise, post-Shang dynasty pieces would also contain that rare form of lead. Choice A is incorrect. Despite these pieces containing 'a rare form of lead,' there is no direct claim in the passage that Shang dynasty bronze is itself more rare or valuable than bronze pieces from other periods. Therefore, there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the nature of the bronze in Chinese artifacts changed after the Shang dynasty, bronze was still used to create artifacts after this time. The passage in fact explicitly states 'bronze artifacts from China dated after the Shang dynasty…,' indicating that bronze was still used in China after the Shang dynasty. Choice D is incorrect.

Brecht’s inﬂuence can be seen in English playwright Caryl Churchill’s 1979 play Cloud 9: although the play sometimes invites empathetic reactions, it primarily works to engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism, which it does by placing audiences at a distance, thereby encouraging them to ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "focus on the characters’ beliefs about social and political issues as revealed by the characters’ actions.","B": "reﬂect on social and political phenomena not directly related to patriarchy and colonialism.","C": "recognize pertinent social and political parallels between Germany during Brecht’s time and England at the time when urchill was writing oud 9.","D": "be dispassionate as they think critically about the social and political questions raised by the play.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. Churchill’s play was inﬂuenced by Brecht’s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an emotional response from audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the play. Therefore, it makes sense that Churchill would strive to have audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically about the social and political questions raised by the play. Choice A is incorrect. The passage mentions that Churchill was inﬂuenced by Brecht’s belief that plays should provoke audience members “to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the characters and events depicted onstage,” so there’s no basis for an inference about audience members deeply engaging with characters’ beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorrect. Reﬂecting on things that aren’t related to patriarchy and colonialism wouldn’t “engage audiences in an interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism.” That creates a confusing contradiction.

Researchers Benjamin T. Cardenas and Michael P. Lamb recently added to this debate by using data from NASA and the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter to map the topography of what is now a large basin in Mars’s northern hemisphere. Cardenas and Lamb concluded that the wet and warm scenario is likely correct. Which ﬁnding about the basin, if true, would most directly support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion?","A": "Its dimensions and shape indicate that it is unlikely to have formed as the result of an asteroid or comet impact.","B": "It has features suggesting that it once held an ocean that underwent gradual sea-level changes over an extended time.","C": "Its physical characteristics are most consistent with it having formed as a result of a massive but short-lived inﬂux of liquid water.","D": "It is surrounded by channels that could have been formed either by running water or by ﬂowing lava.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. This choice provides direct support for the researchers’ conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean of liquid water for 'an extended time,' that supports the 'wet and warm scenario' on Mars, which involved a 'prolonged' period of temperate conditions (and not just a 'brief period of melting'). Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t provide support for the researchers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin have little bearing on whether or not it was ﬁlled with liquid water, and for how long, and that’s the evidence that would support the 'wet and warm' theory. Similarly, whether or not the basin was formed by an asteroid or a comet is irrelevant to the question of whether or not there was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorrect. This choice does not provide support for the researchers’ conclusions, but rather the opposite. A 'massive but short lived inﬂux' of liquid water is not the same as a 'prolonged phase of warm, wet conditions.' It more reﬂects the opposing theory, a 'brief period of melting.' Choice D is incorrect. This choice does not support Cardenas and Lamb’s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars ('wet and warm' and 'brief period of melting') involve ﬂowing water, but lava isn’t mentioned at all in the text.

Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful ﬂock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene.

In the text, Heidi screams upon ﬁrst seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon ﬁrst seeing the image, the text’s description of the image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail.

After establishing that Buck views most people “as nothing,” the text explains that Buck won’t acknowledge people other than Thornton unless they appear friendly toward Thornton, and even then he’s only reluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornton has a special status in Buck’s mind, with Buck holding him in higher regard than other people. Choice A is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck isn’t social with people other than Thornton but doesn’t address Buck’s life or temperament before he lived with Thornton. Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Buck doesn’t really care about people other than Thornton and is aloof toward them. However, there’s no indication that Buck mistrusts and avoids people generally; indeed, he accepts Thornton, who is a human.

Whitten described this process as making an entire painting in “one gesture,” signaling a clear departure from the prevalence of gestures in his work from the 1960s. Some art historians claim this shift represents “removing gesture” from the process.

However, as more and more Indigenous people exclusively speak a globally dominant language, such as English, their ancestral languages fade from daily use. These facts lend added importance to tribal nations’ efforts to preserve their languages. By ensuring the continued use of Cherokee, Ojibwe, and the hundreds of other Indigenous languages in what is now the United States, tribal nations are also ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "increasing the number of medicinal plants represented in the vocabularies of Indigenous languages.","B": "transmitting terms for medicinal plants from Indigenous languages to globally dominant languages.","C": "preserving knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations’ lands.","D": "ensuring that citizens of tribal nations have physical access to medicinal plants.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the relationship between Indigenous languages and knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. The text states that Indigenous cultures possess special knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, which is reﬂected in their vocabulary. The text then discusses how tribal nations are working to preserve their languages, whose daily use is declining as globally dominant languages become increasingly dominant in Indigenous communities. Given that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as repositories of knowledge about plants’ medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on knowledge about the medicinal value of plants native to the tribal nations’ lands. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that preserving Indigenous languages will increase the knowledge, not the number, of medicinal plants. Choice B is incorrect because the text is concerned with how vocabulary about the medicinal value of plants can be preserved through the continued daily use of Indigenous languages, not with how such vocabulary can be incorporated into globally dominant, non-Indigenous languages. Moreover, the text explains that the exclusive use of globally dominant languages in Indigenous communities comes at an expense to the continued daily use of those communities’ languages. Given this relationship, it is unlikely globally dominant languages would borrow Indigenous vocabulary pertaining to plants’ medicinal uses. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss physical access to medicinal plants, instead focusing on Indigenous knowledge and language surrounding the medicinal uses of plants.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "d3d3217e","Question": "An archaeological team led by Piotr Bieliński and Sultan al-Bakri found remnants of a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age board game at a site in Oman.

The text explains that the remains of a 4,000-year-old board game were found in Oman. The text then states that scholars claim this board game was played mostly by traders. If the other known examples of this board game from the same time period were discovered along routes that seem to have been used primarily by traders, this ﬁnding would directly support the scholars’ claim because it suggests that the game was largely played by traders who brought it with them for entertainment as they traveled. Choice A is incorrect because this ﬁnding would suggest only that a single trader may have possessed examples of the board game, perhaps for the purpose of trading or selling the game to residents of Oman. For this reason, the ﬁnding wouldn’t directly support the scholars’ claim that the majority of the game’s players were traders. Choice B is incorrect because this ﬁnding doesn’t mention the board game at all, referring only to similar games found at other sites, and would therefore provide no direct support for the scholars’ claim about the board game.

Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but could also attract predators. But biologist Karin Kjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals to see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked human participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a nonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue.

The text indicates that although some scientists have assumed that iridescence could attract predators, Kjernsmo’s team wondered if iridescent insects might be harder for other animals to see. The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren’t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If participants located most of the purple or blue wings but far fewer of the iridescent wings, that ﬁnding would support the team’s idea since it would suggest that noniridescent wings are easier to see than iridescent wings. Choice B is incorrect because if participants located the iridescent wings more quickly than the purple or blue wings, that ﬁnding would weaken the team’s idea, not support the team’s idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings were easier to see than the noniridescent wings. Choice C is incorrect because ﬁnding that some participants believed that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings would be irrelevant to the team’s idea. The purple and blue wings were both noniridescent, so any difference in how easy those two colors were to see would have nothing to do with the idea that iridescent insects are harder to see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorrect because if some participants found all the wings, that wouldn’t support the team’s idea that iridescent insects may be harder to see than noniridescent insects. If anything, this ﬁnding might weaken the team’s idea since it could suggest that iridescence had no effect on how diﬃcult the wings were to see.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "d8451066","Question": "“To You” is an 1856 poem by Walt Whitman.

This quotation makes that point directly by saying to readers, “You have not known what you are.” The quotation goes on to reinforce this point using a metaphor of sleep, saying that readers have “slumber’d” and that their “eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead characterizes readers as “immense” and “interminable.” Although immense and interminable things can be diﬃcult to understand, this quotation doesn’t make that point. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t suggest that readers haven’t fully understood themselves but instead conveys the speaker’s regret over not having celebrated readers sooner. In fact, this quotation says nothing at all about readers themselves—it’s focused solely on the speaker’s feelings about readers.

The decrease in the proportion of monks in England isn’t relevant to the question of Henry VIII’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. Details about how the monks were treated during the dissolution don’t address Henry VIII’s motivations for enacting the policy in the ﬁrst place.

The text explains that the Cantares Mexicanos contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion. Choice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers’ unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain’s.

The text discusses Fiorelli and colleagues’ discovery of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Brazilian mine. According to the text, the presence of these eggs, which are from the Late Cretaceous period, led the researchers to conclude that the location was once a nesting and breeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the ﬁnding is important because of the “previous lack of known nesting sites in northern regions of South America.” If there haven’t been any other discoveries of a nesting site in South America’s northern regions and the site in the Brazilian mine is the ﬁrst, then the text strongly suggests that the site is farther north than other nesting sites that have been discovered in South America. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the site discovered by Fiorelli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur nesting and breeding site known to paleontologists but rather that it’s the ﬁrst nesting site found in northern regions of South America. Moreover, the text doesn’t suggest how the timeline of the newly discovered site compares with that of other titanosaur nesting and breeding sites.

One reason for this is that geologic and climate data collected by a spacecraft showed that the crust was largely composed of basalt, likely as a result of intense volcanic activity that brought about a magma ocean, which then cooled to form the planet’s surface. A study led by Valerie Payré focused on additional information—further analysis of data collected by the spacecraft and infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface—that revealed the presence of surprisingly high concentrations of silica in certain regions on Mars. Since a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica, Payré concluded that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "the information about silica concentrations collected by the spacecraft is likely more reliable than the silica information gleaned from infrared wavelengths detected from Mars’s surface.","B": "high silica concentrations on Mars likely formed from a different process than that which formed the crusts of other planets.","C": "having a clearer understanding of the composition of Mars’s crust and the processes by which it formed will provide more insight into how Earth’s crust formed.","D": "Mars’s crust likely formed as a result of other major geological events in addition to the cooling of a magma ocean.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. Cooling magma would create basalt, but “a planetary surface that formed in a mostly basaltic environment would be unlikely to contain large amounts of silica.” Since Mars’s crust does contain large amounts of silica, it is unlikely that Mars’s crust was formed exclusively by cooling magma.

The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn’t account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist.

The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however, have long been thought to be undeﬁnable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modiﬁed piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven times likelier to characterize the modiﬁed songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","A": "synchronized offbeats tend to give a song swing regardless of whether downbeats are delayed.","B": "the acoustic properties that give a song swing are not easy for jazz musicians to manipulate.","C": "jazz songs that feature the piano are more likely to have swing than are jazz songs that do not feature the piano.","D": "the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The passage tells us that participants were “more than seven times likelier to characterize the modiﬁed songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing.” Because the modiﬁed songs had been changed by altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing. Choice A is incorrect. Although the passage mentions that the researchers “synchronized the offbeats” in the modiﬁed songs, they also “delayed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can’t disentangle whether it was the synchronized offbeats, the delayed downbeats, or the combination of both that increased the song’s swing, we don’t have enough information to make this inference. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn’t mention whether or not it’s diﬃcult for a jazz musician to give a song swing, so there’s no basis for this inference. Choice C is incorrect. The passage doesn’t compare jazz songs that feature piano to those that don’t, so there’s no basis for this inference.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "e9b05dd3","Question": "King Lear is a circa 1606 play by William Shakespeare. In the play, the character of King Lear attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him. He later expresses regret for his actions, as is evident when he ______ Which choice most effectively uses a quotation from King Lear to illustrate the claim?","A": "says of himself, “I am a man / more sinned against than sinning.”","B": "says during a growing storm, “This tempest will not give me leave to ponder / On things would hurt me more.”","C": "says to himself while striking his head, “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!”","D": "says of himself, “I will do such things— / What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be / The terrors of the earth!”","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively uses a quotation from King Lear to illustrate the claim that King Lear expresses regret for his actions. In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head—the same act he’s engaged in as he speaks, and one that suggests he’s deeply upset with himself. Referring to himself in the second person (with “thy”), the character exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters’ devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have “sinned against” him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by “sinning.” Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn’t express King Lear’s sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (“this tempest”), which he believes “will not give [him] leave to ponder,” or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (“things” that “would hurt [him] more”). Choice D is incorrect because this quotation expresses King Lear’s vow to commit terrible actions (or “things” that “shall be / The terrors of the earth”) in the future, not his regret over actions that he’s already taken.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "ec51463b","Question": "Matthew D. Rocklage and team examined whether consumer ratings of movies can predict box oﬃce success. The team considered both numeric star ratings and written reviews in their research. To analyze the written reviews, the team measured the emotionality—the degree to which a written review expresses an emotional reaction—of user reviews on a movie rating website, assigning each review an emotionality score. After reviewing this research, a student argues that the emotionality of movie reviews is unrelated to a movie’s success at the box oﬃce. Which ﬁnding, if true, would most directly weaken the student’s conclusion?","A": "Movies that had the highest average emotionality scores received the lowest average star ratings on the movie rating website.","B": "The average emotionality score of a movie’s reviews was a positive predictor of that movie’s box oﬃce earnings.","C": "More than half of the movies that the team examined received an average star rating of 3 out of 5 stars.","D": "The movies that were most successful at the box oﬃce tended to have high average star ratings.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. This choice weakens the student’s conclusion by suggesting that the emotionality of movie reviews is related to box oﬃce success: the higher the emotionality score, the better the movie performs at the box oﬃce. Choice A is incorrect. While this choice does mention emotionality scores, it only connects them to star ratings, not to box oﬃce success. Choice C is incorrect. The fact that many movies received an average star rating doesn’t tell us anything about the relationship between emotionality and box oﬃce success. Choice D is incorrect.

The text explains that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries digital technologies lowered book production costs most signiﬁcantly in manufacturing and distribution. The text goes on to point out that authoring, editing, and book design are distinct steps in the process that occur before manufacturing and distribution. Because the savings connected to digital technologies have been most signiﬁcant in manufacturing and distribution, it’s reasonable to infer that those technologies had less of an effect on writing, editing, and designing books. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on lowered book production costs that occur after authoring has taken place; there’s no indication in the text whether digital technologies made writing and publishing lengthy books easier. Choice B is incorrect. Although it’s logical to conclude that customers would expect the cost of books to decline if production costs have declined, the text doesn’t address customer expectations for the cost of books or any other consumer goods.

The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again. According to the text, why are ecologists worried about Pando?","A": "It isn’t growing at the same rate it used to.","B": "It isn’t producing young trees anymore.","C": "It can’t grow into new areas because it is blocked by fences.","D": "Its root system can’t support many more new trees.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation that is directly stated in the text for why ecologists are worried about Pando. The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the largest organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando’s growth is declining, partly because animals are feeding on the trees. In other words, the ecologists are worried that Pando isn’t growing at the same rate it used to. Choice B is incorrect. Rather than indicating that Pando isn’t producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando’s young trees, not that Pando itself can’t grow in new areas because it’s blocked by fences.

Elinor lives with her younger sisters and her mother, Mrs. Dashwood. Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualiﬁed her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught. According to the text, what is true about Elinor?","A": "Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.","B": "Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.","C": "Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.","D": "Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides a detail about Elinor that is established in the text. The text indicates that although Elinor is “only nineteen,” she gives good advice and exhibits such a high level of understanding and judgment that she serves as “the counsellor of her mother.” Thus, Elinor is mature beyond her years. Choice A is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text says that Elinor advises her mother and often counteracts her mother’s impulses, there’s no mention of Elinor arguing with her mother or failing to change her mother’s mind. Choice B is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has strong feelings, it doesn’t indicate that she’s excessively sensitive when it comes to family issues. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t supported by the text: there’s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad role model.

The text describes a study assessing how children think of rewards and fairness and its results. It concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared more about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud. Choice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being “four to six,” and the text doesn’t mention any differences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect.

The text indicates that the proportion of military veterans working in civilian government jobs is considerably higher than the proportion of military veterans in the population as a whole. The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it’s reasonable to infer that it’s the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there’s no indication that it’s atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they’ve left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn’t address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys that military veterans may be particularly interested in civilian government jobs due to the familiarity of organizational structures that are already in place, but there’s no reason to think that this interest would mean that more civilian government jobs will start to require military experience.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "f3b7cb07","Question": "The Land of Enchantment is a 1906 travel book by Lilian Whiting.

The text explains that up until Wang and his team’s discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from the paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identiﬁed fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the paleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team’s discovery was signiﬁcant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid species were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Wang and his team identiﬁed fossilized remains of a mixopterid species that lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn’t indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a more recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn’t suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team conﬁrmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought.

In the quotation, the speaker makes it clear that she plans to walk somewhere based on her own wishes (“where my own nature would be leading”) rather than follow anything else (“another guide”), and that she’ll walk “in ferny glens” alongside the mountain. Choice A is incorrect because this quotation suggests that the speaker wants to avoid pursuing money and education (“busy chase of wealth and learning”) and instead return to some earlier interests (her “ﬁrst feelings”); the quotation doesn’t address her determination to experience the countryside. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker is describing the circumstances under which she won’t walk, which doesn’t address her determination to experience the countryside.

Participant 20 gave a −2 comfort rating, a full three points colder on the scale than the other two participants. Choice A is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Participant 1 and participant 21 reported the same level of comfort, but participant 20’s comfort level was three points lower. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t use data from the table. The table only shows us one survey, so we don’t know if the participants’ ratings varied throughout the day. Choice D is incorrect. This choice misreads the table. Participant 1 and participant 21 reported the same level of comfort.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "fe595863","Question": "In addition to her technical skill and daring feats, American stunt pilot Bessie Coleman was also known for dazzling the crowds that came to watch her air shows in the 1920s with her exuberant personality. During her career, she was careful and purposeful about how she crafted her public persona. An aviation researcher has claimed that Coleman intentionally deﬁed social norms of the time by how she chose to present herself to the public. Which quotation from an article about Coleman would most directly support the aviation researcher’s claim?","A": "“For her air shows, Coleman frequently used the Curtiss JN-4, or ‘Jenny,’ which at that time was one of the most well- known types of planes.”","B": "“While Coleman was beloved by spectators for her charisma, she had a more complicated relationship with her managers and staff, who at times found her behavior too impulsive and demanding.”","C": "“leman once considered leaving her career as a stunt pilot to focus her efforts on giving speeches, which she felt would better support her public image.”","D": "“Although female pilots were typically expected to wear traditional but impractical attire that included dresses or skirts, photographs of Coleman show her wearing pants and leather jackets.”","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. This choice supports the claim of Coleman’s intentional deﬁance of social norms: female pilots were expected to wear skirts, but Coleman wore pants and leather jackets instead. Choice A is incorrect. Coleman ﬂew a well-known, common plane, which would not have deﬁed social norms among pilots. Choice B is incorrect. Her complicated relationship with managers and staff would not have been a component of Coleman’s public persona. This choice also fails to mention any “social norms of the time.” Choice C is incorrect. While this quotation suggests that Coleman was careful and purposeful about her public image, it doesn’t directly mention anything about “social norms of the time.”","Difficulty": "Medium"}]
