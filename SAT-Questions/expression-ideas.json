Sonic Meditations is not music but rather a series of sound-based exercises called meditations. Each meditation consists of instructions for participants to make, imagine, listen to, or remember sounds. The instructions for Meditation V state, “walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears.” Those for Meditation XVIII state, “listen to a sound until you no longer recognize it.” The student wants to provide an explanation and an example of Oliveros’s Sonic Meditations. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?","A": "Sonic Meditations is not music but rather a series of sound-based meditations that consist of instructions; Meditation XVIII, for instance, instructs participants to “listen to a sound until you no longer recognize it.”","B": "In 1971, Oliveros created Sonic Meditations, a series of meditations that consist of instructions for participants to make, imagine, listen to, or remember sounds.","C": "“Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears” is one example of the instructions found in Oliveros’s Sonic Meditations.","D": "While both meditations consist of instructions, Meditation XVIII instructs participants to “listen,” whereas Meditation V instructs participants to “walk.”","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer.

She was studying ﬁrsthand the color-saturated style of France’s modernist masters and beginning to make a name for herself as a painter. ______ Sher-Gil longed to return to her childhood home of India; only there, she believed, could her art truly ﬂourish. Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?","A": "Still,","B": "Therefore,","C": "Indeed,","D": "Furthermore,","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. “Still” logically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence—that she longed to leave Paris and return to India—contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris in the previous sentences. Choice B is incorrect because “therefore” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence is a result or consequence of the descriptions in the previous sentences. Instead, this information contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris. Choice C is incorrect because “indeed” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence offers additional emphasis in support of the descriptions in the previous sentences. Instead, this information contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris. Choice D is incorrect because “furthermore” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence offers additional support for or conﬁrmation of the descriptions in the previous sentences.

Over one hundred US cities have redesigned their ﬂags since 2015. The city of Pocatello, Idaho, redesigned its ﬂag after it was named the most poorly designed ﬂag in North America. Pocatello’s new ﬂag better represents the city’s mountainous geography and civic priorities. Residents consider the new ﬂag to be a meaningful symbol of civic pride. The student wants to make and support a generalization about the effect of redesigning a city ﬂag.
