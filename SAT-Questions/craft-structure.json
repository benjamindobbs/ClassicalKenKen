[{"ID": "0094f813","Question": "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John wants to travel far beyond the village where he lives near his mother, Matty. [John] had on several occasions attempted to reconcile his mother to the notion, but found it a diﬃcult task. Matty always took refuge in self-pity and tears. Her son’s desires were incomprehensible to her, that was all. As used in the text, what does the phrase “reconcile his mother to” most nearly mean?","A": "Get his mother to accept","B": "Get his mother to apologize for","C": "Get his mother to match","D": "Get his mother to reunite with","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The expression “reconcile to” means “to cause (a person) to accept something diﬃcult or disagreeable.” The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn’t like that idea. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t make sense. John doesn’t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a ﬁght, but it actually doesn’t make sense. The text never suggests that John’s mother was “united with” the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it seems like she’s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person “reunites with” a notion.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "00bfdbd7","Question": "The fashion resale market, in which consumers purchase secondhand clothing from stores and online sellers, generated nearly $30 billion globally in 2019. Expecting to see continued growth, some analysts ______ that revenues will more than double by 2028. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "produced","B": "denied","C": "worried","D": "predicted","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fashion resale market’s continued growth. As used in this context, “predicted” means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that some analysts “produced,” or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn’t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “denied,” or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn’t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “worried,” or felt concerned, that revenue would signiﬁcantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "032fd227","Question": "Many archaeologists assume that large-scale engineering projects in ancient societies required an elite class to plan and direct the necessary labor. However, recent discoveries, such as the excavation of an ancient canal near the Gulf Coast of Alabama, have complicated this picture. Using radiocarbon dating, a team of researchers concluded that the 1.39-kilometer- long canal was most likely constructed between 576 and 650 CE by an Indigenous society that was relatively free of social classes. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?","A": "It describes a common view among archaeologists, then discusses a recent ﬁnding that challenges that view.","B": "It outlines a method used in some archaeological ﬁeldwork, then explains why an alternative method is superior to it.","C": "It presents contradictory conclusions drawn by archaeologists, then evaluates a study that has apparently resolved that contradiction.","D": "It identiﬁes a gap in scientiﬁc research, then presents a strategy used by some archaeologists to remedy that gap.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The text starts by introducing a common view among archaeologists about the need for an elite class to direct large-scale engineering projects. Then, it discusses the discovery of a large canal most likely built by a society without an elite class, which challenges the ﬁrst view. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text discusses carbon dating as an archaeological method, it doesn’t compare it to any other alternative methods. Choice C is incorrect. The study doesn’t resolve any contradictions—rather, it introduces a contradiction to the one view presented at the beginning of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text never identiﬁes any gaps in scientiﬁc research.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "03c10074","Question": "The mimosa tree evolved in East Asia, where the beetle Bruchidius terrenus preys on its seeds. In 1785, mimosa trees were introduced to North America, far from any B. terrenus. But evolutionary links between predators and their prey can persist across centuries and continents. Around 2001, B. terrenus was introduced in southeastern North America near where botanist Shu-Mei Chang and colleagues had been monitoring mimosa trees. Within a year, 93 percent of the trees had been attacked by the beetles. Which choice best describes the function of the third sentence in the overall structure of the text?","A": "It states the hypothesis that Chang and colleagues had set out to investigate using mimosa trees and B. terrenus.","B": "It presents a generalization that is exempliﬁed by the discussion of the mimosa trees and terrenus.","C": "It provides context that clariﬁes why the species mentioned spread to new locations.","D": "It offers an alternative explanation for the ﬁndings of Chang and colleagues.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exempliﬁed by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and B. terrenus beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no B. terrenus beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey 'can persist across centuries and continents.' Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the ﬁndings by Chang and colleagues that’s an 'alternative' to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "0534fba8","Question": "Following the principles of community-based participatory research, tribal nations and research institutions are equal partners in health studies conducted on reservations.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "circumvents","B": "eclipses","C": "fabricates","D": "exempliﬁes","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the collaboration between the Crow Tribe and Montana State University. As used in this context, “exempliﬁes” means demonstrates. The text conveys how the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves to illustrate the model of community-based participatory research introduced earlier in the text and expanded on later in the text. Choice A is incorrect because referring to “circumvents,” or avoids, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration serves as an example of the principles of community-based participatory research, not that the collaboration evades this model. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “eclipses,” or overshadows, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text describes the Crow Tribe–Montana State University collaboration as an equal partnership, which indicates that it’s an example of the community-based participatory research model, not that it overshadows the model. Choice C is incorrect because saying that the collaboration “fabricates,” or creates, the model wouldn’t make sense in context.

Great reaches, yet unknown, Await For your possession. I may not, if I would, Retrace the way with you, My pilgrimage is through, But life is calling you! Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To express hope that a child will have the same accomplishments as his parent did","B": "To suggest that raising a child involves many struggles","C": "To warn a child that he will face many challenges throughout his life","D": "To encourage a child to embrace the experiences life will offer","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life. Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her son in a positive light when she says that “great reaches, yet unknown” are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the son is consistent throughout the text.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "05fc9eec","Question": "The following text is adapted from Paul Laurence Dunbar’s 1902 novel The Sport of the Gods. Joe and some of his family members have recently moved to New York City. [Joe] was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant. In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes, and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going. Back home there had been no place much worth going to, except church and one or two people’s houses. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "It illustrates a character’s reaction to a new environment.","B": "It explains why a character has traveled to a city.","C": "It compares a character’s thoughts about an event at two different times of day.","D": "It presents a character feeling regret over leaving home.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "a collaboration","B": "an accessory","C": "a contradiction","D": "an analogy","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu 'identif[ied] broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena,' comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unrelated phenomena, this ﬁts the context perfectly. Choice A is incorrect. 'A collaboration' refers to 'an act of working with others,' but what comes after the semicolon doesn’t describe collaboration with other researchers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two different (but ultimately similar) scientiﬁc phenomena. Choice B is incorrect. 'An accessory' can refer to 'something added to increase attractiveness or usefulness.' No accessories are described in this text. Choice C is incorrect. 'A contradiction' means 'a set of ideas or things that are opposed to or inconsistent with each other.' The text describes how Hu used the similarity between ant and light particle movement to develop his method, so a word that refers to difference would not make sense here.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "09d1bf78","Question": "The following text is from Holly Goldberg Sloan’s 2017 novel Short. More than two years ago my parents bought a piano from some people who were moving to Utah. Mom and Dad gave it to my brothers and me for Christmas. I had to act really happy because it was such a big present, but I pretty much hated the thing from the second it was carried into the hallway upstairs, which is right next to my bedroom. The piano glared at me. It was like a songbird in a cage. It wanted to be set free. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "It explains why the narrator always wanted a piano close to her bedroom.","B": "It establishes how the narrator feels about the piano.","C": "It suggests that the narrator’s brothers are talented piano players.","D": "It describes the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy a piano.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "preventable","B": "undeniable","C": "common","D": "concerning","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species can be avoided. As used in this context, “preventable” means able to be stopped or kept from happening. The text indicates that “people can take simple steps” to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments. It presents these steps as an example of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “undeniable,” or something that can’t be proved to be wrong. Although the text may suggest that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is something that really happens, the word that completes the text must make the ﬁrst sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not undeniable. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “common,” or something that happens regularly. Additionally, the text doesn’t provide any information about how frequently invasive species cause biodiversity loss. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “concerning,” or something that is troubling or causes worry. Although the text implies that the phenomenon of biodiversity loss due to invasive species is itself a concerning phenomenon, the word that completes the text must make the ﬁrst sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not concerning.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "0b016420","Question": "Using NASA’s powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Mercedes López-Morales and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light traveling through the atmosphere of WASP-39b, an exoplanet, or planet outside our solar system.

Then the text discusses the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding, both as the ﬁrst evidence of CO₂ in an exoplanet’s atmosphere and as an illustration of the JWST’s potential for making new discoveries in general. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t compare two different methods, but rather focuses on one study that used the JWST. Choice C is incorrect.

His most important paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon’s colleagues, said that the bit was “[Shannon’s] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung.” Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?","A": "It presents a theoretical concept, illustrates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has entered common usage.","B": "It introduces a respected researcher, describes an aspect of his work, and suggests why the work is historically signiﬁcant.","C": "It names the company where an important mathematician worked, details the mathematician’s career at the company, and provides an example of the recognition he received there.","D": "It mentions a paper, offers a summary of the paper’s ﬁndings, and presents a researcher’s commentary on the paper.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The text starts with a general statement that introduces Shannon, then describes a speciﬁc contribution from one of his papers, then provides a quote that illustrates just how important this contribution was. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text only mentions very brieﬂy, in parentheses, that “binary digit” was shortened to “bit.” It doesn’t go into detail about this name change, and it doesn’t discuss any “common usage” of the name at all. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. Shannon’s employment at Bell Labs is only mentioned once, very brieﬂy: the text never goes into detail about his career there, and it never mentions any recognition he received there.

The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reﬂecting changes in the cultural life of the city. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To compare the Balmy ley murals to other murals in San Francisco","B": "To offer an overview of the history and importance of the lmy Alley murals","C": "To urge people to protect the murals of San Francisco from decay","D": "To describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco beginning in the 1970s","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by brieﬂy stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are signiﬁcant because they reﬂect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t speciﬁcally discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this speciﬁc collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a speciﬁc area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "0d9d50d7","Question": "According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican American women made crucial contributions to the labor movement during World War II. At the time, food processing companies entered into contracts to supply United States armed forces with canned goods. Increased production quotas conferred greater bargaining power on the companies’ employees, many of whom were Mexican American women: employees insisted on more favorable beneﬁts, and employers, who were anxious to fulﬁll the contracts, complied. Thus, labor activism became a platform for Mexican American women to assert their agency. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a particular industry made earlier in the text.","B": "It offers an example of a trend in the World War II–era economy discussed earlier in the text.","C": "It notes a possible exception to the historical narrative of labor activism sketched earlier in the text.","D": "It provides further details about the identities of the workers discussed earlier in the text.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text says that the increased production quotas of food processing companies during World War II enabled employees to make better bargains in exchange for their labor. The underlined portion presents an example of this increased bargaining power: employees requested more favorable beneﬁts, and employers complied because they were under pressure to fulﬁll the demanding terms of their contracts. Thus, the underlined portion of the text elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a particular industry (food processing) made earlier in the text. Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the economic factors that inﬂuenced food processing also inﬂuenced other parts of the economy; thus, the bargaining described in the underlined portion of the text cannot be called an example of a trend. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion supports the historical narrative of labor activism in food processing that is sketched in the text, instead of noting an exception to that narrative.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "repudiates","B": "proclaims","C": "foretells","D": "recants","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sterlin Harjo’s approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or aﬃrms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned.

By comparing the growth rings on the planks to records of similar rings in oaks from Europe, the team could trace the wood to the Jura region of France, hundreds of kilometers from Rome. Because timber could only have been transported from distant Jura to Rome by boat, the team’s ﬁndings suggest the complexity of Roman trade routes.

The ﬁrst sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France’s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the ﬁndings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a diﬃcult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s ﬁndings. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s ﬁndings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "restrained","B": "inventive","C": "inexplicable","D": "mystifying","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the art installation Anthem. In this context, “inventive” means characterized by invention and creativity. The text explains that critics’ responses to the installation involved praise for Tsang’s creative transformation of a space into a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe such an exhibit as “restrained,” or limited and not extravagant or showy. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that critics found the installation “inexplicable,” or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation’s transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound.

Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landﬁll.

Choice B is incorrect. The text does mention that Price’s compositions have been performed and recorded by major orchestras, but it doesn’t argue that more orchestras should do so. Choice C is incorrect. The text does mention the blending of Black spirituals and classical European Romantic musical traditions, but only brieﬂy, as part of a broader overview of Price’s career.

As used in the text, what does the word “quality” most nearly mean?","A": "Standard","B": "Prestige","C": "aracteristic","D": "Accomplishment","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. “This quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Standard” is a synonym for a different deﬁnition of “quality”: the degree of excellence of something. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t what “quality” means in this context. Here, “this quality” refers to Gatsby’s “resourcefulness of movement,” which is described as a characteristic or trait of his. “Prestige” would suggest a high status or an admirable reputation, which doesn’t match that description.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "depleted","B": "homogeneous","C": "immature","D": "dispersed","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jha and Kremen’s ﬁnding about bees’ foraging behavior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of ﬂowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identiﬁed a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Speciﬁcally, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the ﬂowers are largely from the same species— they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of ﬂowers the bees encounter are homogeneous. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter ﬂower patches that are not rich in species, not if the ﬂowers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if ﬂowers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the ﬂower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the ﬂower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the ﬂowers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense ﬂower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "166021c8","Question": "Anthropologist Kristian J.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "surpassed by","B": "comparable to","C": "independent of","D": "obtained from","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot. As used in this context, “comparable to” would mean similar to. The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of “frequent climbers,” such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were “surpassed by,” or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot’s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot’s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were “independent of,” or not inﬂuenced by or aﬃliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees.

At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for “a little amusement among ourselves” and aren’t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of “some respectable author” is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom’s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Tom had earlier intentions for the play’s performance or that anything has changed since the group ﬁrst decided to stage a play. Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entire endeavor will be. Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom mentions that using the words of a “respectable author” will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren’t skilled enough to stage a play.

Then it describes a shortcoming of some works in that ﬁeld (they say how but not why), and ﬁnally it states that other works try to avoid that shortcoming (by including both how and why to live a morally good life). Choice B is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don’t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life. Rather, the text claims that works of moral philosophy that don’t include both how and why to be moral are not useful to readers who don’t already want to be moral. Choice C is incorrect.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "unpredictable","B": "important","C": "secretive","D": "ordinary","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Juarez. In this context, “important” means marked by signiﬁcant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the ﬁrst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of ﬁgure in Mexico’s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the “many signiﬁcant accomplishments” from Juarez’s long tenure in oﬃce. This context conveys that Juarez is a signiﬁcant and consequential ﬁgure in Mexico’s history. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez’s role as the ﬁrst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oﬃce; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was “unpredictable,” or tended to behave in ways that couldn’t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly “secretive” ﬁgure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the ﬁrst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government’s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the ﬁrst president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oﬃce.

The text provides an overview of a scholarly work discussing the fashion practices of Black female farmworkers in late 19th- and early 20th-century Texas, and how these practices were inﬂuenced by both the fashion ideals of the time and the demands of farmwork. Choice A is incorrect. The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen’s ﬁndings as 'unexpected.' Choice B is incorrect. The text actually explains that Black female farmworkers were trying to achieve traditional feminine ideals, not resist them. Choice C is incorrect.

The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante’s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels “transported with joy” after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character’s happiness after reading the letter. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there’s no explanation why another character hasn’t written one. In addition, the text’s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy posture” suggests that he’s sad and thoughtful, not that he’s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect.

As used in the text, what does the word “beckoning” most nearly mean?","A": "Demanding","B": "Signaling","C": "Inviting","D": "Shifting","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting,” or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at “trees in their spring beauty.” She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the “easy unhuman loveliness” of trees: she thinks of cities as “seductive” and “charming,” both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are “demanding,” or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though “signaling,” or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of “beckoning,” in the context here, “beckoning” suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "recognizable","B": "intriguing","C": "signiﬁcant","D": "useful","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identiﬁable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “signiﬁcant,” or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more signiﬁcant in humans.

In this context, “reﬂect” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the signiﬁcance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind.

Based on the texts, how would Dubey and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the consensus view discussed in Text 1?","A": "By suggesting that curiosity may not be exclusively motivated by the desire to merely acquire information","B": "conceding that people may seek out information that serves no immediate purpose only because they think they can use it later","C": "By pointing out that it is challenging to determine when information-seeking serves no goal beyond acquiring information","D": "By disputing the idea that curiosity can help explain apparently purposeless information-seeking behaviors","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The researchers in Text 2 recognize that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, but showed that this motivation can still be affected by other factors, like whether or not the information is expected to be useful or not. This suggests that other desires may play a part in driving people to acquire information. Choice B is incorrect. The consensus view in Text 1 is that people acquire information regardless of whether they think they can use it later. Dubey and colleagues acknowledge this fact (so they don’t claim people seek out information “only” because it might be useful later). Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the results of Dubey and colleagues’ study in Text 2. Neither text discusses the diﬃculty of determining the motivation for information-seeking. Choice D is incorrect. This choice contradicts Text 2, which starts with Dubey and colleagues “acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator” (i.e., agreeing that curiosity explains the seeking of apparently purposeless information). The research in Text 2 simply suggests that more than just curiosity can motivate information-seeking behavior when the information has a purpose.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "23767ca5","Question": "Scientists previously thought that all electric eels belong to a single species, but a team of researchers led by zoologist C. David de Santana proved this idea wrong by ______ that there are in fact three distinct species of electric eels. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "pretending","B": "complaining","C": "requiring","D": "demonstrating","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. “Demonstrating” means “showing,” and the text describes how de Santana disproved a previous belief in only one species of electric eel by showing that three electric eel species actually exist. Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn’t prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won’t prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it. Choice C is incorrect. “Requiring” means “needing.” It wouldn’t make sense to say that de Santana “needed” there to be three distinct species of electric eel.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "2b265404","Question": "Sueño de Familia is an exhibition of drawings, paintings, and ceramics that explores the artistic heritage of US-based artist Yolanda González. The exhibition ______ ﬁve generations, featuring works by González’s great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece as well as González herself. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "borrows","B": "spans","C": "judges","D": "neglects","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Sueño de Familia art exhibition. In this context, “spans” means extends across or covers. The text states that the exhibition explores González’s artistic heritage and features artwork by her great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece. This context conveys the idea that the exhibition spans, or extends across, ﬁve generations of González’s family. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the exhibition “borrows,” or acquires, ﬁve generations of González’s family. The text indicates that the exhibition features artwork by family members from ﬁve generations, not that the ﬁve generations themselves have been acquired for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the purpose of the exhibition is to highlight artwork, not to “judge,” or give an opinion on, ﬁve generations of the artist’s family. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the exhibition “neglects,” or gives little attention to, ﬁve generations of González’s family. On the contrary, the text indicates that the exhibition is dedicated to exploring González’s artistic heritage and therefore designed to bring attention to her family members and their artwork.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "2c0fce04","Question": "The following text is adapted from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1837 story “Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment.” The main character, a physician, is experimenting with rehydrating a dried ﬂower. At ﬁrst [the rose] lay lightly on the surface of the ﬂuid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the ﬂower were reviving from a deathlike slumber. As used in the text, what does the phrase “a singular” most nearly mean?","A": "lonely","B": "A disagreeable","C": "An acceptable","D": "An extraordinary","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried” petals shift, and the entire ﬂower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the ﬂower. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because “singular” means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "2c46da8b","Question": "The following text is adapted from Mohsin Hamid’s 2017 novel Exit West. Saeed lives with his mother and father. On cloudless nights after a daytime rain, Saeed’s father would sometimes bring out the telescope, and the family would sip green tea on their balcony, enjoying a breeze, and take turns to look up at objects whose light, often, had been emitted before any of these three viewers had been born—light from other centuries, only now reaching Earth. ©2017 by Mohsin Hamid As used in the text, what does the word “reaching” most nearly mean?","A": "riving at","B": "Consulting with","C": "Running to","D": "Clinging to","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The word 'reaching' in this text means 'to arrive' at Earth. Before, the light had been traveling across space; now, it had arrived at Earth. Choice B is incorrect. 'Consulting with' means 'seeking advice or information from someone.' Light is not alive, so it can’t consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It’s confusing to say that starlight is 'only now running to Earth,' both because light doesn’t literally 'run' and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it’s traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as 'clinging to' has a connotation of 'sticking to.' It wouldn’t make sense to say that the light was 'only now' clinging to Earth.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "30673ac1","Question": "The following text is adapted from Zora Neale Hurston’s 1921 short story “John Redding Goes to Sea.” John is a child who lives in a town in the woods. Perhaps ten-year-old John was puzzling to the folk there in the Florida woods for he was an imaginative child and fond of day-dreams. The St. John River ﬂowed a scarce three hundred feet from his back door. On its banks at this point grow numerous palms, luxuriant magnolias and bay trees. On the bosom of the stream ﬂoat millions of delicately colored hyacinths. [John Redding] loved to wander down to the water’s edge, and, casting in dry twigs, watch them sail away down stream to Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and [he] wanted to follow them. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?","A": "It provides an extended description of a location that John likes to visit.","B": "It reveals that some residents of John’s town are confused by his behavior.","C": "It illustrates the uniqueness of John’s imagination compared to the imaginations of other children.","D": "It suggests that John longs to experience a larger life outside the Florida woods.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text establishes that John has a strong imagination and then goes on to describe the St. John River near John’s home in the Florida woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand his life experiences beyond the Florida woods. Choice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect because the ﬁrst sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence elaborates on John’s imagination but doesn’t mention any other children to whom John could be compared.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "3067b065","Question": "Interruptions in the supply chain for microchips used in personal electronics have challenged an economist’s assertion that retailers can expect robust growth in sales of those devices in the coming months. The delays are unlikely to ______ her projection entirely but will almost certainly extend its time frame. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "dispute","B": "withdraw","C": "underscore","D": "invalidate","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the economist’s claim about sales of personal electronic devices. In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the delays will “underscore,” or emphasize, the economist’s projection. Instead, the text suggests that the delays are likely to extend the time frame of the economist’s projection but not to undermine the projection entirely.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "32816015","Question": "The following text is from Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 novel The Secret Garden. Mary, a young girl, is outside trying her new jump rope. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one walk and down another. As used in the text, what does the word “rough” most nearly mean?","A": "Harsh","B": "Scratchy","C": "Basic","D": "Vague","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, 'rough' most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s 'a little wind.' To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word 'rough' with a description of the wind blowing in 'delightful little gusts,' suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts 'rough' objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, 'delightful little gusts,' which suggests that the use of 'rough' here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t 'basic,' or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in 'delightful little gusts.' Choice D is incorrect because the word 'vague' means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "32897050","Question": "Sumerian civilization (which lasted from around 3300 to 2000 BCE) ______ many concepts that persist into present-day civilizations: for example, the ﬁrst description of the seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "transformed","B": "introduced","C": "inherited","D": "overlooked","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian civilization. In this context, “introduced” means brought into practice or use. The text states that the ﬁrst reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “transformed,” or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations. Instead, the text’s presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the ﬁrst description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the ﬁrst half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the ﬁrst description of the seven-day week suggests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the seven-day week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it “inherited” the concepts, or received them from an ancestral ﬁgure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the ﬁrst description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the ﬁrst half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians “overlooked,” or failed to notice or consider, such concepts.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "340b33cd","Question": "Stephen Hannock’s luminous landscape paintings are appealing to viewers but have elicited little commentary from contemporary critics, a phenomenon that may be due to the very fact that the paintings seem so ______. Many critics focus their attention on art that is cryptic or overtly challenging. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "innovative","B": "subversive","C": "profound","D": "accessible","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. When talking about a thing, “accessible” means “easy to understand.” This sets up the contrast in the next sentence, which tells us that critics mostly focus on art that is “cryptic or challenging” (meaning not easy to understand). Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t ﬁt the logic of the text. The next sentence tells us that critics focus on art that is mysterious and challenging. If Hannock’s paintings are “innovative” (meaning advanced and original), then critics probably would comment on them. Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t ﬁt the logic of the text. The next sentence tells us that critics focus on art that is mysterious and challenging. If Hannock’s paintings are “subversive” (meaning disruptive and revolutionary), then critics probably would comment on them. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t ﬁt the logic of the text.

Before the discovery, Denisovans were thought to have lived only at high altitudes in relatively cold climates in what are now Russia and China, but the discovery of the tooth in Laos suggests that they may have lived at low altitudes in relatively warm climates in Southeast Asia as well. Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It dismisses as untrue the research presented in the previous sentence.","B": "It deﬁnes a term used in the description that follows in the rest of the sentence.","C": "It emphasizes the main goal of the research introduced in the previous sentence.","D": "It provides context that clariﬁes the signiﬁcance of the information that follows in the rest of the sentence.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text describes how a new discovery expands our understanding of Denisovans. The underlined portion describes what we used to believe about Denisovans, which helps the reader understand the signiﬁcance of the discovery of the molar: it suggests that they lived in more places than we’d previously thought. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. Instead, it explains what we used to believe about Denisovans before the discovery—it doesn’t dismiss the new discovery as false.

But chemist Takunda Chazovachii has helped develop a cleaner process of chemical recycling that converts superabsorbent polymers from diapers into a desirable reusable adhesive. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "resilient","B": "inadequate","C": "dynamic","D": "satisfactory","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about recycling plastics. In this context, “inadequate” means not satisfactory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes “the loss of material quality.” The text contrasts that with Chazovachii’s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text’s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “resilient” would mean able to withstand diﬃculty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any diﬃculties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “dynamic” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the ﬁeld of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii’s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “satisfactory” would mean acceptable but not perfect. The text mentions only shortcomings of the mechanical process (environmental effects and lower material quality), so the text more strongly supports a negative view of this process and provides no evidence that it would be considered satisfactory.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "35e921f5","Question": "Hiroshi Senju is known worldwide for his paintings of waterfalls. These paintings are large and tend not to show the entire waterfall. Instead, Senju focuses on just the point where the falling water reaches the pool below, keeping the top of the waterfall out of view. While Senju’s paintings are rooted in art movements originating in the United States, the artist uses traditional Japanese techniques and materials that make his work instantly recognizable. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?","A": "It introduces an artist and then explains some common characteristics of well-known paintings by that artist.","B": "It explains a speciﬁc painting technique and then provides examples of artists who use the technique.","C": "It describes a famous painting and then compares it to a lesser-known painting from the same time period.","D": "It gives an opinion on an artist and then suggests multiple reasons why the artist’s work has been largely overlooked.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. The ﬁrst sentence introduces Senju as a famous artist, while the next three sentences describe the deﬁning features of his art, such as it only showing part of the waterfall and its origins in US art movements and Japanese techniques. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide examples of any other artists who use Senju’s techniques. Choice C is incorrect.

In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those photographs with magniﬁed images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the images for display in the exhibition. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “validated,” or corroborated, the series of images. The text describes Jeyifous’s process for composing the images but doesn’t describe Jeyifous making an effort to evaluate the images for their artistic or scientiﬁc legitimacy. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “challenged,” or disputed, an aspect of the images; rather, the focus of the text is on the inspiration behind the images and the method Jeyifous used to achieve them.

To me alone it is a time of pause, A void and silent space between two worlds, When inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps, Gathering strength for efforts yet to come. As used in the text, what does the phrase “a void” most nearly mean?","A": "useless","B": "An empty","C": "A forgotten","D": "An incomplete","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as 'a void' space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature’s 'surging life is at its full' during the season, the speaker feels summer to be 'a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds.' The speaker says further that during summer, 'feeling sleeps / Gathering strength' for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn’t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when 'feeling' gathers 'strength for efforts yet to come.' Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time 'when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,' it doesn’t discuss the season’s relationship to the speaker’s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, 'void' can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "invent","B": "simulate","C": "exaggerate","D": "preserve","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of climate activity in Earth’s distant past. In this context, to “simulate” most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth’s early climate is diﬃcult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth’s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth’s climate in the distant past. Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth’s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to “invent,” or imagine, a completely ﬁctional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth’s past climate might have been like. They are not attempting to “exaggerate,” or distort, those features.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "legitimate","B": "impenetrable","C": "compelling","D": "indecipherable","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler’s career. In this context, “impenetrable” means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the ﬁeld of science ﬁction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science ﬁction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science ﬁction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn’t view the genre as impossible to enter. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “legitimate” would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn’t think the science ﬁction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that ﬁeld. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, “compelling” would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science ﬁction, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that she didn’t see the ﬁeld as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn’t consider science ﬁction “indecipherable,” or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "aggressive","B": "rudimentary","C": "evolving","D": "advantageous","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of single-celled organism behavior. As used in this context, “rudimentary” means basic or unsophisticated. According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan Stentor roeseli showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of Stentor roeseli showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “evolving,” or advancing.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “advantageous,” or helpful.

[Mr. Brooke] had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the country to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as diﬃcult to predict as the weather. As used in the text, what does the word “contracted” most nearly mean?","A": "Restricted","B": "Described","C": "Developed","D": "Settled","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “contracted” most nearly means developed. The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a “too rambling habit of mind,” which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text. Choice A is incorrect. Although “contracted” can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke’s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorrect because settled means calmed or mitigated, but here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow calmed or mitigated.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "4259636f","Question": "In Jane Austen’s novel Mansﬁeld Park, an almost imperceptible smile from potential suitor Henry Crawford causes the protagonist Fanny Price to blush; her embarrassment grows when she suspects that he is aware of it. This moment—in which Fanny not only infers Henry’s mental state through his gestures, but also infers that he is drawing inferences about her mental state—illustrates what literary scholar George Butte calls “deep intersubjectivity,” a technique for representing interactions between consciousnesses through which Austen’s novels derive much of their social and psychological drama. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?","A": "It states a claim about sten’s skill at representing psychological complexity that is reinforced by an example presented in the following sentence.","B": "It advances an interpretation of an Austen protagonist who is contrasted with protagonists from other Austen novels cited in the following sentence.","C": "It describes a recurring theme in Austen’s novels that is the focus of a literary scholar’s analysis summarized in the following sentence.","D": "It provides a synopsis of an interaction in an Austen novel that illustrates a literary concept discussed in the following sentence.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides a concrete example to ground readers’ understanding of the “deep intersubjectivity” described in the next sentence as central to Austen’s work. Choice A is incorrect. There is no evaluation made of Austen’s skill in this sentence, and no examples are given in the following sentence. This choice essentially ﬂips the paragraph: it’s this ﬁrst sentence that provides an example. Choice B is incorrect. There are no other Austen protagonists mentioned in this passage, so this couldn’t be the answer. Choice C is incorrect.

The ﬁrst three sentences describe the general situation: these early ﬁlms have been lost, and we only know about them from small pieces of evidence. The rest of the text offers speciﬁc examples of the small pieces of evidence. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The fact that we only know about these lost early ﬁlms from small pieces of evidence isn’t presented as a “complex problem”—that’s too extreme. And the examples presented are not “unsuccessful attempts” to solve it. If anything, the examples represent a success, because we discovered that these ﬁlms existed in the ﬁrst place.

It did seem that the picture failed to ﬁt in with the rest of the shop. A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chieﬂy on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his ﬂaming bits of landscape. “Don’t belong in here,” he fumed. And yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shuﬄed about pondering the least ridiculous place for the picture. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To reveal the shop owner’s conﬂicted feelings about the new picture","B": "To convey the shop owner’s resentment of the person he got the new picture from","C": "To describe the items that the shop owner most highly prizes","D": "To explain differences between the new picture and other pictures in the shop","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to ﬁt in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conﬂicted feelings about the new picture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner’s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identiﬁes some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "4531fbbf","Question": "Economist Marco Castillo and colleagues showed that nuisance costs—the time and effort people must spend to make donations—reduce charitable giving.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "enhance","B": "hinder","C": "misrepresent","D": "aggravate","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Booker T. Whatley. In this context, “hinder” means hold back or obstruct. The text explains that Whatley encouraged farms to allow customers on site to pick their own produce for a fee. He did so despite critics’ concerns that the customers would never pay to do so. This context establishes that the critics’ concerns didn’t hinder Whatley’s efforts to promote the practice. Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that critics’ skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn’t have some effect on Whatley’s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley’s “determined advocacy” for the practice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn’t obstruct Whatley’s efforts, not that critics’ concerns didn’t “enhance,” or increase or improve, Whatley’s efforts. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “misrepresent” would mean portray inaccurately, and the text includes no information relevant to the issue of how Whatley’s efforts were portrayed by critics of the practice of charging customers to pick their own produce. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that critics’ skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn’t have some effect on Whatley’s promotion of the practice.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "complementary","B": "unknown","C": "disparate","D": "interchangeable","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the artistic styles that have inﬂuenced Cannon’s work. As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have inﬂuenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal ﬂatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have inﬂuenced Cannon’s work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the inﬂuences on Cannon’s artwork, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that the inﬂuences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one another’s deﬁciencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s inﬂuences as “unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the inﬂuences are known because the text goes on to list them.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "surmised","B": "contrived","C": "questioned","D": "regretted","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "acknowledged","B": "ensured","C": "denied","D": "underestimated","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nuttall’s 1886 research paper. In this context, “acknowledged” means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall’s work as groundbreaking because of its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall’s work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “ensured” would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall’s work recognition after it was published, but there’s no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that other researchers “denied,” or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall’s work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures.

Now the women began to test the trees—moving leisurely among them, axe in hand, and striking a single quick blow, to see if the sap would appear. The trees, like people, have their individual characters; some were ready to yield up their life- blood, while others were more reluctant. Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree, and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made. From the corners of this chip—at ﬁrst drop by drop, then more freely—the sap trickled into the little dishes.

The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to ﬁnd out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personiﬁcation, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap— that the women are evaluating. Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees’ willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneﬁcial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe beneﬁt from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees beneﬁt from this relationship in turn.

Instead of using standard shapes and colors, she typically explored innovative forms and daring hues. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "creative","B": "bold","C": "traditional","D": "understandable","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Helen Liu Fong’s architectural designs. In this context, “traditional” means conventional. The text states that rather than use “standard shapes and colors,” Fong pursued “innovative” and “daring” design choices in her work. Fong’s style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong’s work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong’s design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used “daring” hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn’t have avoided them.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "avoided","B": "featured","C": "appreciated","D": "disregarded","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of traﬃc signals. As used in this context, “featured” means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US traﬃc signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn’t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was ﬁrst developed. Before then, the text suggests, traﬃc signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word “only” in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traﬃc signals featured only red and green lights. Choice A is incorrect because “avoided” means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traﬃc signals look like. The text states that they didn’t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because “appreciated” means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US traﬃc signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn’t mention how this characteristic or traﬃc signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “traﬃc signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because “disregarded” means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context.

Lily Bart and a companion are walking through a park. Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the ﬁtting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?","A": "It creates a detailed image of the physical setting of the scene.","B": "It establishes that a character is experiencing an internal conﬂict.","C": "It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on.","D": "It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “ﬁtting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reﬂect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reﬂection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds speciﬁc details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conﬂict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reﬂects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reﬂect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "deceptive","B": "innocuous","C": "novel","D": "impractical","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ward and colleagues’ ﬁndings. As used in this context, “innocuous” means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and “less benign.” This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are “deceptive,” or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. The text doesn’t suggest that any of these stimuli are “novel,” or original and new; heat, vibration, and electricity aren’t new inventions.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "unobtrusive","B": "concealed","C": "approximate","D": "peripheral","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the location of the province of Xoconochco within the Aztec Empire. As used in this context, “peripheral” means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "5873ade0","Question": "Biologist Jane Edgeloe and colleagues have located what is believed to be the largest individual plant in the world in the Shark Bay area of Australia. The plant is a type of seagrass called Posidonia australis, and it ______ approximately 200 square kilometers. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "acknowledges","B": "produces","C": "spans","D": "advances","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. “Spans” means “extends over a distance of” or “encompasses.” Since we’re talking about the world’s largest plant, it makes sense to say that it “spans” about 200 square kilometers. Choice A is incorrect. “Acknowledges” means “recognizes” or “admits the truth of.” Either way, it doesn’t make sense here: a plant can’t “acknowledge” a distance. Choice B is incorrect. “Produces” can mean “makes,” “causes,” or “presents.” But none of those deﬁnitions make sense here: a plant can’t make, cause, or present a distance. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t ﬁt the logic of the text. “Advances” means “moves forward” or “progresses.” But the plant isn’t necessarily moving forward.

This ﬁnding may persuade researchers who have argued that Bronze Age societies were ruled by men to ______ that women may have also held leadership roles. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "waive","B": "concede","C": "refute","D": "require","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the signiﬁcance of the 2014 archaeological ﬁnding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after ﬁrst resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the ﬁnding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s ﬁnding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory.

A ______ viburnum plant, on the other hand, will have leaves with smooth surfaces and uniformly green coloration. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "struggling","B": "beneﬁcial","C": "simple","D": "healthy","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of damage to viburnum plants. In this context, “healthy” would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase “on the other hand” indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against diﬃculties. The text ﬁrst describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing diﬃculties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “beneﬁcial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “simple” would mean plain or uncomplicated. The text doesn’t discuss whether certain viburnum plants are complicated or uncomplicated; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "5b03feaf","Question": "Critics have asserted that ﬁne art and fashion rarely ______ in a world where artists create timeless works for exhibition and designers periodically produce new styles for the public to buy.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "prevail","B": "succumb","C": "diverge","D": "intersect","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about the relationship between ﬁne art and fashion. As used in this context, “intersect” means to connect or overlap. The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics’ view as being inﬂuenced by a perception that ﬁne artists create works that are “timeless” and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that ﬁne art and fashion tend not to overlap—in other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that critics contend that ﬁne art and fashion rarely “prevail,” or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it’s possible to make ﬁne art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that ﬁne art and fashion rarely “succumb,” or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe ﬁne art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that ﬁne art and fashion rarely “diverge,” or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma’s work as both ﬁne art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that ﬁne art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "5ead5de0","Question": "Researchers have struggled to pinpoint speciﬁc causes for hiccups, which happen when a person’s diaphragm contracts ______. However, neuroscientist Kimberley Whitehead has found that these uncontrollable contractions may play an important role in helping infants regulate their breathing. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "involuntarily","B": "beneﬁcially","C": "strenuously","D": "smoothly","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. In this context, “involuntarily” means done without any control, or by reﬂex. The text explains that when a person’s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneﬁcial for infants), those muscle contractions are “uncontrollable.” This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person’s control. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t support the logical relationship established in the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although speciﬁc causes for hiccups haven’t been identiﬁed, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn’t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur “beneﬁcially,” or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants’ breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are “uncontrollable.” Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person’s control, it wouldn’t make sense to describe them as occurring “strenuously,” or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are “uncontrollable.” Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur “smoothly,” or evenly and continuously.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "5f6c6854","Question": "Physicist Joseph Weber performed ______ work in gravitational wave research in the 1960s and 1970s, conducting key experiments that scientists later used as the basis for their own investigations that led to the ﬁrst veriﬁed detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "foundational","B": "supplementary","C": "repetitive","D": "ineffective","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of physicist Joseph Webster’s research on gravitational waves. In this context “foundational” means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster’s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and “key” to, the work of later scientists in the ﬁeld; thus, Webster’s work was foundational to the later scientists’ experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster’s work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was “the basis for” later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster’s work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster’s work formed the basis for later investigations in the ﬁeld of gravitational wave research. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster’s work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome.

Julius [was] very useful when we moved to our new residence. He had a thorough knowledge of the neighborhood, was familiar with the roads and the watercourses, knew the qualities of the various soils and what they would produce, and where the best hunting and ﬁshing were to be had. He was a marvelous hand in the management of horses and dogs. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To compare the narrator’s reaction to a new home with his wife’s reaction","B": "To give an example of Julius’s knowledge about soil","C": "To show that the narrator and Julius often hunt and ﬁsh together","D": "To explain different ways in which Julius was helpful","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain different ways in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and ﬁshed together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and ﬁshed together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and ﬁsh—a detail that supports the text’s main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "601b8d64","Question": "In the mid-nineteenth century, some abolitionist newspapers ______ westward migration in the United States; by printing a letter that described the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California during the Gold Rush, Frederick Douglass’s newspaper North Star was one such publication that inspired readers to relocate. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "stimulated","B": "assigned","C": "opposed","D": "disregarded","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. 'Stimulated' means 'encouraged interest or increased activity in.' Because the newspapers discussed the beneﬁts of westward migration and 'inspired readers to relocate,' we can infer that they encouraged people to move west. Choice B is incorrect. 'Assigned' means 'gave a job or duty.' Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. 'Opposed' means 'disapproved of.' We can tell that this isn’t the case, because the newspapers discussed 'the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California' and 'inspired readers to relocate.' Choice D is incorrect.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "epitomizing","B": "transcending","C": "anticipating","D": "reinforcing","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to 'mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those ﬁelds.' 'Transcending' means 'going beyond,' so 'transcending traditional boundaries' would mean crossing into all those various ﬁelds of research, which is exactly the meaning we want. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to 'mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those ﬁelds.' To 'epitomize' means to 'be a perfect example of,' so 'epitomizing traditional boundaries' would mean the opposite of what we want: keeping the ﬁelds of research separate. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice. Based on the text, we’re looking for a word that means something similar to 'mak[ing] use of insights and techniques from all those ﬁelds.' 'Anticipating' means 'expecting' or 'waiting for,' and would result in a confusing sentence with an unclear meaning. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t a logical word choice.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "selects","B": "originates","C": "conditions","D": "replenishes","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata. As used in this context, “replenishes” means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps Hierochloe odorata, increasing both their “number and vigor.” This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting Hierochloe odorata actually replenishes the wild population. Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it’s not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select “wild populations” of plants. Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, “originates” means creates. The text doesn’t address the origin of Hierochloe odorata, but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “conditions” means to inﬂuence someone or something to behave in a certain way, and the text doesn’t suggest the new plants that replace the harvested ones differ in any meaningful way, or in any way that could be the result of conditioning.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "62bb43f6","Question": "Part of the Atacama Desert in Peru has surprisingly rich plant life despite receiving almost no rainfall. Moisture from winter fog sustains plants once they’re growing, but the soil’s tough crust makes it hard for seeds to germinate in the ﬁrst place. Local birds that dig nests in the ground seem to be of help: they churn the soil, exposing buried seeds to moisture and nutrients. Indeed, in 2016 Cristina Rengifo Faiffer found that mounds of soil dug up by birds were far more fertile and supported more seedlings than soil in undisturbed areas. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It elaborates on the idea that the top layer of acama Desert soil forms a tough crust.","B": "It describes the process by which seeds are deposited into Atacama Desert soil.","C": "It identiﬁes the reason particular bird species dig nests in Atacama Desert soil.","D": "It explains how certain birds promote seed germination in Atacama sert soil.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins. Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identiﬁes a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "6721a0e1","Question": "The printing of Virginia Woolf’s novels featured a creative ______ between Woolf and her sister Vanessa Bell: a talented painter, Bell worked closely with Woolf to create original cover art for most of the novels. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "rebellion","B": "partnership","C": "discovery","D": "disagreement","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf’s novels. In this context, “partnership” means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf’s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf’s novels. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a “rebellion,” or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf’s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a “discovery,” or encountered anything new for the ﬁrst time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship.

The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms. They greeted her as an old friend. Soon she reached the river-side. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It suggests that Shakti feels uncomfortable near the river.","B": "It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of direction in the woods.","C": "It emphasizes Shakti’s sense of belonging in the landscape.","D": "It conveys Shakti’s appreciation for her long-term friendships.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” ﬁguratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "67aeed94","Question": "In Nature Poem (2017), Kumeyaay poet Tommy Pico portrays his ______ the natural world by honoring the centrality of nature within his tribe’s traditional beliefs while simultaneously expressing his distaste for being in wilderness settings himself. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "responsiveness to","B": "ambivalence toward","C": "renunciation of","D": "mastery over","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of how Pico feels about the natural world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over nature.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "697dcd7e","Question": "The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1895 play The Importance of Being Earnest.

The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. As used in the text, what does the word “endure” most nearly mean?","A": "Regret","B": "Persist","C": "Tolerate","D": "Encourage","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known brieﬂy and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "699c6598","Question": "In the 1970s, video cameras became increasingly affordable for ordinary consumers and gave Ulysses Jenkins and other artists capabilities that were previously unavailable except to television broadcasters.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "newfound","B": "delicate","C": "inevitable","D": "habitual","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’s video art. As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn’t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. Choice B is incorrect because “delicate” means ﬁne in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "synchronization","B": "hibernation","C": "prediction","D": "moderation","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, “synchronization” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant ﬂower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before ﬂowering. Choice B is incorrect because referring to “hibernation,” or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing ﬂowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about ﬂowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular ﬂowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to ﬂower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to “moderation,” or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn’t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant’s ﬂowering activity; the two plants simply ﬂower in unison.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "6e30747e","Question": "The following text is from Herman Melville’s 1854 novel The Lightning-rod Man.

A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertiﬁcation, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists’ livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert. Text 2 Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara’s desertiﬁcation. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn’t exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation. Based on the texts, how would Chris Brierley (Text 2) most likely respond to the discussion in Text 1?","A": "By pointing out that given the revised timeline for the end of the Sahara’s humid period, the Neolithic peoples’ mode of subsistence likely didn’t cause the region’s desertiﬁcation","B": "claiming that pastoralism was only one of many behaviors the Neolithic peoples took part in that may have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate","C": "By insisting that pastoralism can have both beneﬁcial and deleterious effects on a region’s vegetation and climate","D": "By asserting that more research needs to be conducted into factors that likely contributed to the desertiﬁcation of the Sahara region","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it. Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible beneﬁcial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect.

Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.

The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they’re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn’t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations.

Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item’s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb’s theory, an item’s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A “motivation” is “a reason for doing.” Items don’t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last.

The ﬁrst two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientiﬁc term that is used in the discussion that follows. Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered diﬃculties in their study.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "borrow","B": "postpone","C": "protect","D": "decorate","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. 'Protect' means 'preserve' or 'keep safe from.' By ensuring that the wilderness areas along the Appalachian Trail can’t be sold or developed, the National Trails System Act protects them. Choice A is incorrect. 'Borrow' means 'to take something with intent to return it.' The text doesn’t say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail. Choice B is incorrect. 'Postpone' means 'to put off until later.' Nothing in the passage suggests that Congress wants to 'postpone' the wilderness areas (and that doesn’t make sense anyway—they can postpone doing something to the wilderness areas, but they can’t postpone the areas themselves). Choice D is incorrect. 'Decorate' means 'to adorn' or 'add extra items or pictures to make more attractive.'

Polly, a teenager, is visiting her friend Fanny. Fanny’s friends did not interest Polly much; she was rather afraid of them [because] they seemed so much older and wiser than herself, even those younger in years. They talked about things of which she knew nothing and when Fanny tried to explain, she didn’t ﬁnd them interesting; indeed, some of them rather shocked and puzzled her. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To portray Polly’s reaction to Fanny’s friends","B": "To identify the topics Polly talks about with Fanny’s friends","C": "To explain how Fanny met some of her friends","D": "To illustrate how Fanny’s friends feel about Polly","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show how Polly reacted to some of Fanny’s other friends. The text describes Polly as being frightened of Fanny’s friends because they seemed “much older and wiser” to her and elaborates that they “talked about things of which” Polly was unfamiliar, uninterested, and shocked. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe Polly’s impressions of Fanny’s other friends. Choice B is incorrect because the text does not provide any of the topics Polly discussed with Fanny’s friends, stating only that Polly found the topics unfamiliar, uninteresting, and shocking. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Fanny and her other friends ﬁrst met. Choice D is incorrect because the focus of the text is on Polly’s feelings about Fanny’s other friends, not on the other friends’ feelings about Polly.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "8a991dc8","Question": "Michelene Pesantubbee, a historian and citizen of the Choctaw Nation, has identiﬁed a dilemma inherent to research on the status of women in her tribe during the 1600s and 1700s: the primary sources from that era, travel narratives and other accounts by male European colonizers, underestimate the degree of power conferred on Choctaw women by their traditional roles in political, civic, and ceremonial life. Pesantubbee argues that the Choctaw oral tradition and ﬁndings from archaeological sites in the tribe’s homeland supplement the written record by providing crucial insights into those roles.

The text begins by stating a problem with research on the status of Choctaw women in the 1600s and 1700s: written primary sources underestimate the power they had in their traditional roles. Then it presents one historian’s solution: looking to oral tradition and archeological ﬁndings for more insight into these roles. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never says that research should avoid written primary sources, just that research should also use oral tradition and archeological sites as sources. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never mentions the advantages of using written primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure.

The genetic material can then be transferred “vertically” in the second species— that is, through reproductive inheritance. Scientist Atma Ivancevic and her team have hypothesized infection by invertebrate parasites as a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer between vertebrate species: while feeding, a parasite could acquire a gene from one host, then relocate to a host from a different vertebrate species and transfer the gene to it in turn. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It explains why parasites are less susceptible to horizontal gene transfer than their hosts are.","B": "It clariﬁes why some genes are more likely to be transferred horizontally than others are.","C": "It contrasts how horizontal gene transfer occurs among vertebrates with how it occurs among invertebrates.","D": "It describes a means by which horizontal gene transfer might occur among vertebrates.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text deﬁnes horizontal gene transfer and then gives one possibility for how it happens in vertebrates (via infection by parasites). The underlined part describes how that mechanism could work. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion doesn’t do this. Parasites are only described as the mechanism that does the transferring, not the species that gives or receives the genes.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "accuracy","B": "inactivity","C": "complexity","D": "restraint","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel The Books of Jacob. As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are diﬃcult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is diﬃcult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a diﬃcult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "9027e78b","Question": "By combining Indigenous and classical music, Cree composer and cellist Cris Derksen creates works that reﬂect the diverse cultural landscape of Canada. For her album Orchestral Powwow, Derksen composed new songs in the style of traditional powwow music that were accompanied by classical arrangements played by an orchestra. But where an orchestra would normally follow the directions of a conductor, the musicians on Orchestral Powwow are led by the beat of a powwow drum. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To examine how Derksen’s musical compositions blend cultures","B": "To argue that Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music","C": "To describe the diﬃculties Derksen encountered when producing her album","D": "To establish a contrast between rksen’s classical training and her Cree heritage","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen’s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album Orchestral Powwow feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Speciﬁcally, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen’s compositions blend different cultures. Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen’s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn’t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any diﬃculties Derksen encountered when producing her album. Rather, the text describes how the songs on the album exemplify how Derksen combines music from two different cultures. Choice D is incorrect because although the text mentions Derksen’s Cree heritage and suggests that she relies on knowledge of both Indigenous and classical music when she composes her songs, it doesn’t discuss her musical training.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "predicting","B": "refusing","C": "hiding","D": "creating","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sam Gilliam’s artworks. As used in this context, “creating” means producing or bringing something into existence. The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings. This context supports the idea that Gilliam explored different styles in his art by creating special types of paintings. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Gilliam actually explored and pursued the creation of quilt-like paintings; he wasn’t just “predicting,” or declaring in advance, the existence of these paintings. Choice B is incorrect because in this context “refusing” would mean rejecting, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that Gilliam rejected his quilt-like paintings. Instead, the text indicates that he was exploring and pursuing a new art style in these paintings.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "interjected","B": "committed","C": "illustrated","D": "prescribed","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare’s comedies. As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of deﬁance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time. Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that society has “committed,” or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that have been “illustrated,” or clariﬁed with examples.

The text states that Ochoa “doesn’t have a deﬁnite idea” about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa’s prediction as a “conjecture,” or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction. Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “demands,” or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that she’s unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “doubts,” or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Ochoa “establishes,” or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

As used in the text, what does the word “suggestion” most nearly mean?","A": "Trace","B": "Opinion","C": "Dispute","D": "Command","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “suggestion” most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: “My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,” says the narrator, “and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.” This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator’s soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “suggestion” can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn’t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While “suggestion” might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn’t refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "admired","B": "disagreed with","C": "warned","D": "depended on","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg’s collection. In this context, the phrase “depended on” means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve “books, art, and other materials” created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn’t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. Choice A is incorrect because “admired” means respected and approved of. Although it’s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn’t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because “disagreed with” means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg’s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world.

The ﬁrst two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed speciﬁcally laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out ﬁnding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a speciﬁc behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds’ nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "9aadb463","Question": "The following text is from Sarah Orne Jewett’s 1899 short story “Martha’s Lady.” Martha is employed by Miss Pyne as a maid.

Martha was just coming in from the garden with the strawberries, and with more ﬂowers in her apron. It was a bright cool evening in June, the golden robins sang in the elms, and the sun was going down behind the apple-trees at the foot of the garden. The beautiful old house stood wide open to the long-expected guest. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To convey the worries brought about by a new guest","B": "To describe how the characters have changed over time","C": "To contrast the activity indoors with the stillness outside","D": "To depict the setting as the characters await a visitor’s arrival","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately reﬂects the main purpose of the text. The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and ﬂowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks “stately and calm,” the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was “wide open to the long- expected guest,” which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne’s anticipation and Martha’s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor. Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest’s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was “long-expected,“ but characterizing Miss Pyne as “stately and calm” conﬂicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect.

Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that The Two Noble Kinsmen was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered suﬃcient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one- volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the ﬁrst act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.

Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identiﬁable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. Choice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to the women of Massinger’s plays. Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "compliance with","B": "exposure to","C": "criteria for","D": "forfeiture of","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. 'Exposure to' means 'having contact with.' It makes sense that Prasad and Bainbridge were investigating whether seeing false versions of images was a cause of false visual memories. Notice how 'exposure to incorrect renditions' matches the idea of 'familiarity with erroneous versions,' which appears later in the sentence. Choice A is incorrect. 'Compliance with' means 'going along with a command or directive.' False versions of images can’t give commands or directives, so this doesn’t apply. Choice C is incorrect. 'Criteria' means 'standards by which to judge something.' It’s not clear how people would come to have standards for the wrong version of an image in the ﬁrst place, let alone how those standards would cause them to falsely remember the correct version.

They are much less conﬁdent, however, about when this will happen, since that depends on internal characteristics of Betelgeuse that are largely unknown. Astrophysicist Saraﬁna El-Badry Nance and colleagues recently investigated whether acoustic waves in the star could be used to determine internal stellar states but concluded that this method could not suﬃciently reveal Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics to allow its evolutionary state to be ﬁrmly ﬁxed. Which choice best describes the function of the second sentence in the overall structure of the text?","A": "It describes a serious limitation of the method used by Nance and colleagues.","B": "It presents the central ﬁnding reported by Nance and colleagues.","C": "It identiﬁes the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but did not.","D": "It explains how the work of Nance and colleagues was received by others in the ﬁeld.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Saraﬁna El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be suﬃcient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t. Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central ﬁnding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insuﬃcient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "9f5895d3","Question": "The following text is from Charlotte Brontë’s 1847 novel Jane Eyre. Jane, the narrator, works as a governess at Thornﬁeld Hall. I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornﬁeld; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "To convey a contrast between Jane’s outward calmness and internal restlessness","B": "To emphasize Jane’s loyalty to the people she works for at Thornﬁeld Hall","C": "To demonstrate that Jane ﬁnds her situation both challenging and deeply fulﬁlling","D": "To describe Jane’s determination to secure employment outside of Thornﬁeld Hall","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show that while Jane calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. At the start of the text, Jane says, “I went on with my day’s business tranquilly,” indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornﬁeld Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane ﬁnds her current situation fulﬁlling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane’s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she ﬁnds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also ﬁnds that situation satisfying—she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to deﬁnitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she “should” quit her current job (indicating that she hasn’t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could ﬁnd, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts “might germinate and bear fruit if they could,” meaning that the thoughts haven’t yet led to a decision—that Jane isn’t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "a05e2f16","Question": "The following text is from Claude McKay’s 1922 poem “Morning Joy.” The speaker is looking out a window and observing a wold, or large area of land. Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “drew” most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then “drew the shades far down, crept into bed.” That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “drew” can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, “drew” can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "widespread","B": "careful","C": "unintended","D": "infrequent","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the writing system created by Sequoyah. In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conﬂicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conﬂicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "infallible","B": "atypical","C": "lucrative","D": "tedious","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Samuel R. Delany’s character Rydra Wong. As used in this context, “atypical” would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of “nearly a dozen” characters in Delany’s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn’t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany’s works. Choice A is incorrect because “infallible” means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t infallible, or problematic. Choice C is incorrect because “lucrative” means to be proﬁtable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren’t proﬁtable, it wouldn’t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation. Choice D is incorrect because “tedious” means to be boring, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "validate","B": "interpret","C": "relate","D": "accommodate","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of letters allegedly exchanged between President Lincoln and Rutledge. In this context, “validate” means to conﬁrm that something is real or correct. According to the text, it was alleged, or claimed, that the newly discovered letters had been written by Lincoln and Rutledge. The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn’t conﬁrm that the letters were authentic. Choice B is incorrect. The text focuses on the authenticity of the letters, which were claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge and were then quickly dismissed as fraudulent by historians. Rather than conveying that the historians simply weren’t able to “interpret,” or explain in an understandable way, the letters’ authenticity, the text suggests that the historians decided the letters lacked authenticity altogether. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that the historians quickly dismissed the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge as fraudulent; this suggests that rather than being unable to “relate,” or tell others about, the letters’ authenticity, the historians were able to share what they’d decided about the letters. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the historians couldn’t “accommodate,” or give consideration to, the authenticity of the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the historians decided that the letters were fraudulent, which indicates that they did consider whether the letters were authentic.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "a47f5b24","Question": "A musician and member of the Quechua of Peru, Renata Flores Rivera was eager to promote the Quechua language in her music, but she was ______ speaking it.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "prepared for","B": "inexperienced with","C": "skilled in","D": "excited about","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Renata Flores Rivera’s use of Quechua in her music. In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not suﬃciently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “prepared for”—or ready for—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice C is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “skilled in”—meaning good at or capable of—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect. Flores Rivera was likely “excited about”—or thrilled or delighted with—speaking Quechua, but this wouldn’t make sense in context.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "a suitable","B": "a determined","C": "an arbitrary","D": "an unpredictable","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer. “Suitable” means “appropriate for a particular purpose.” Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories. Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker- Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. “Arbitrary” means “based on random choice or whim rather than reason.” But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was “unpredictable.” Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "a5efa231","Question": "In the Indigenous intercropping system known as the Three Sisters, maize, squash, and beans form an ______ web of relations: maize provides the structure on which the bean vines grow; the squash vines cover the soil, discouraging competition from weeds; and the beans aid their two “sisters” by enriching the soil with essential nitrogen. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "indecipherable","B": "ornamental","C": "obscure","D": "intricate","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, “intricate” would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a “web of relations” in which the crops interact in various ways. The text’s description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this “web of relations” is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipherable,” or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical beneﬁts that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not “ornamental,” or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “obscure,” or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context.

This best describes the overall structure of the text. In the ﬁrst half of the text, the speaker describes our attempts to control nature: cultivating, taming, and irrigating different kinds of land. In the second half, the speaker states that we can never tame the sea or the beach. Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t describe the overall structure of the text. The speaker never argues that we should not interfere with nature. Rather, the speaker says that we are able to tame many different kinds of land, but we are unable to tame the sea or beaches.

Given the formation’s greater prevalence among whales known to make deeper dives, some researchers hypothesize that its role isn’t ______; rather, the accessory spleen may actively support diving mechanisms. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "replicable","B": "predetermined","C": "operative","D": "latent","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is “replicable,” or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn’t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn’t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is “predetermined,” or decided in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn’t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "characterization","B": "interpretation","C": "collaboration","D": "commercialization","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of The Mule Bone, a play that Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes wrote together. In this context, “collaboration” means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “characterization” would mean a literary work’s portrayal of characters’ psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn’t discuss characterization in The Mule Bone speciﬁcally or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “interpretation” would mean the explanation of a literary work’s meaning or signiﬁcance, but the text doesn’t discuss how readers or critics have interpreted The Mule Bone; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "conceptualize","B": "neglect","C": "illustrate","D": "overcome","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of delivering biomolecules to plant cells. In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’s diﬃcult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it’s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the diﬃculty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this diﬃculty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “illustrate,” or demonstrate, the diﬃculty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes.

In this context, “collected” means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid’s surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “attached” means connected or aﬃxed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “followed” means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS- REx’s brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it’s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected.

The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that The Epic of Gilgamesh has had a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence than Bosch. Choice A is incorrect because “substantial,” which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch’s inﬂuence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion.

Jinshanzhuang—Hong Kong–based import/export ﬁrms—likely coordinated the ﬁsh’s transport from Chinese-operated ﬁsheries in Vietnam and Malaysia to North American markets. This route reveals the (often overlooked) multinational dimensions of the trade networks linking Chinese diaspora communities. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?","A": "It explains why efforts to determine the country of origin of the items mentioned in the previous sentence remain inconclusive.","B": "It provides information that helps support a claim about a discovery’s signiﬁcance that is presented in the following sentence.","C": "It traces the steps that were taken to locate and recover the objects that are described in the previous sentence.","D": "It outlines a hypothesis that additional evidence discussed in the following sentence casts some doubt on.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The underlined sentence provides information about import/export ﬁrms, showing how Chinese communities across the world were connected by trade routes. Choice A is incorrect. The underlined sentence never suggests that the countries of origin of the ﬁsh are in question—in fact, it tells us exactly where they came from. Choice C is incorrect. The passage never describes the steps taken to discover the ﬁsh bones described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect.

Consider the silver-studded blue butterﬂy (Plebejus argus): as forest growth has reduced grasslands in northern Germany, many of these butterﬂies have left meadow habitats and are now thriving in active limestone quarries. In a survey of multiple active quarries and patches of maintained grassland, an ecologist found silver-studded blue butterﬂies in 100% of the quarries but only 57% of the grassland patches. Moreover, butterﬂy populations in the quarries were four times larger than those in the meadows. Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?","A": "It challenges a common assumption about the species under investigation in the research referred to in the text.","B": "It introduces discussion of a speciﬁc example that supports the general claim made in the previous sentence.","C": "It suggests that a certain species should be included in additional studies like the one mentioned later in the text.","D": "It provides a deﬁnition for an unfamiliar term that is central to the main argument in the text.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife. The underlined portion of the sentence that follows suggests that the silver-studded blue butterﬂy is an example of wildlife thriving in areas of industrial activity: active limestone quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to introduce a speciﬁc example in support of the general claim in the previous sentence. Choice A is incorrect. Although the ﬁrst sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” to harm wildlife, in the case of the silver-studded blue butterﬂy the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge to such an assumption. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only one study: the “survey.” Additional studies are not mentioned in the text.

The narrator is being driven in a carriage through a remote region at night. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. As used in the text, what does the word “disturbed” most nearly mean?","A": "Disorganized","B": "Alarmed","C": "Offended","D": "Interrupted","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "b9d43164","Question": "Some researchers believe that the genes that enable groundhogs and certain other mammals to hibernate through the winter by slowing their breathing and heart rates and lowering their body temperature may be ______ in humans: present yet having essentially no effect on our bodily processes. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "decisive","B": "lacking","C": "variable","D": "dormant","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion about genes related to hibernation. In this context, “dormant” means inactive. The text explains that the same genes that enable certain nonhuman mammal species to hibernate during the winter by altering their bodily processes are also found in our species but have “essentially no effect” on humans’ bodily processes. In other words, these genes don’t function in humans. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “decisive” means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans—that is, the genes don’t affect humans’ bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “lacking” means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "dismiss","B": "provide","C": "regulate","D": "refuse","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the archaeologists’ study of the ancient amphitheater in Switzerland. In this context, “provide” means make available or supply. The text states that the archaeologists believe that the amphitheater dates to the fourth century CE. The text goes on to say that the archaeologists discovered a coin made between 337 and 341 CE (that is, made during the fourth century CE) and building materials appropriate to the era in question. This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. Choice A is incorrect because the archaeologists’ discoveries are presented as supplying evidence in favor of their theory about the dating of the amphitheater, not something that would “dismiss,” or reject serious consideration of, evidence for that theory. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the archaeologists’ discoveries would “regulate,” or govern or bring order to, evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. The discoveries are presented as supplying evidence for the archaeologists’ theory, not as changing how evidence for the theory is controlled or ordered.

Tohru Ikeguchi uses open-source data and statistical modeling to identify when a high number of users making one-way trips is likely to leave some locations within the system ______ bicycles and other areas with insuﬃcient supply. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "susceptible to","B": "contingent on","C": "saturated with","D": "depleted of","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ikeguchi’s model of bicycle supply. In this context, “saturated with” means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi’s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insuﬃcient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are “susceptible to,” or sensitive to or easily inﬂuenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being inﬂuenced by the bicycles. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insuﬃcient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are “contingent on,” or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything. Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are “depleted of,” or empty of, bicycles while others have an insuﬃcient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand—the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "experiment with","B": "adhere to","C": "improve on","D": "grapple with","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of bronze- and brass-casting techniques used by the Igun Eronmwon guild. In this context “adhere to” would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improve on” would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “improve on” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “grapple with” would mean to try hard to solve a diﬃcult problem.

As used in the text, what does the word “answers” most nearly mean?","A": "Explains","B": "Rebuts","C": "Defends","D": "Fulﬁlls","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “answers” most nearly means fulﬁlls. In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more eﬃcient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of modern engineering.” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces. Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean explains, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the topic under discussion is human beings’ inability to perform labor eﬃciently, not their inability to engage in discussion or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean rebuts, or proves a claim or argument to be false, it wouldn’t make sense to speak of proving requirements to be false; requirements might or might not be reasonable, but they can’t be veriﬁed as truthful or untruthful, as claims or accusations can. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “answers” can mean defends against criticism, or justiﬁes, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the opinion that Fabry expresses is that human workers can no longer fulﬁll the requirements of modern workplaces, not that they have ceased to justify those requirements or to defend them against criticism; indeed, there is no suggestion in the text that workers ever defended those requirements.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "c287dfe2","Question": "Logically, a damaged fossil should provide less information than an intact one, but for paleontologist Brigitte Schoenemann, a broken area on a fossilized trilobite (a crustacean-like creature) ______ fresh insight, allowing her to view the inner structure of the organism’s eye. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "resolved","B": "adjusted","C": "offered","D": "directed","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about how, for Schoenemann, a damaged trilobite fossil was informative. In context, “offered” means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite’s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite’s eye. Choice A is incorrect because “resolved” means determined or ﬁgured out, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn’t capable of resolving anything. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil “adjusted,” or changed or modiﬁed, fresh insight wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it adjusted fresh insight.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "skeptical","B": "observant","C": "critical","D": "conﬁdent","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jacob Lawrence’s artistic process. In this context, “observant” means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the “close attention” Lawrence paid to “all the details” of his neighborhood allowed him to reﬂect subtle elements of “the beauty and vitality of the Black experience” in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence’s work as an artist. Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “skeptical,” or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reﬂected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “critical,” which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reﬂects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Lawrence was “conﬁdent,” or self-assured.

The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups.

As used in the text, what does the word “spread” most nearly mean?","A": "Hidden","B": "Discussed","C": "Extended","D": "Coated","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “spread” most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is “huge,” that it covers “numberless acres,” and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

Choice B is incorrect because there are no references in the text to artists other than Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that calls attention to any similarities or differences between Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh.

In this context, “justify” means conﬁrm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars’ skepticism is justiﬁed. Choice A is incorrect because “anticipate” means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues’ research couldn’t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or conﬁrm the scholar’s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because “inspect” means examine or review, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Research ﬁndings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars’ skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ ﬁndings justify, not inspect, the scholars’ skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because “reveal” means uncover or report, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings.

In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are “indicated by,” or signiﬁed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exempliﬁed or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

Years ago, a grave American savant, being in London, observed at an evening party there, a certain coxcombical fellow, as he thought, an absurd ribbon in his lapel, and full of smart [banter], whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire. Great was the savant’s disdain; but, chancing ere long to ﬁnd himself in a corner with the jackanapes, got into conversation with him, when he was somewhat ill-prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes, but was altogether thrown aback, upon subsequently being [informed that he was] no less a personage than Sir Humphry Davy. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?","A": "It portrays the thoughts of a character who is embarrassed about his own behavior.","B": "It presents an account of a misunderstanding.","C": "It offers a short history of how a person came to be famous.","D": "It explains why one character dislikes another.","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. The text tells a story of a ﬁrst impression that turned out to be wrong: a serious American savant was dismissive of a goofy-looking, wisecracking guest at a British party, and then was shocked to learn that the guest was actually a prominent British chemist and inventor. Choice A is incorrect. This is too strong and too narrow. Only at the very end is the savant 'thrown aback' by the fact that the man was Sir Humphry Davy—he’s not 'embarrassed about his own behavior.' Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the main purpose. The text never provides the history of how Sir Humphry Davy came to be famous. Nor does it provide any history for the American savant. Choice D is incorrect. This is too narrow.

And over her face she draws a veil As shimmering ﬁne as ﬂoating dew... And here and there In the black of her hair The subtle hands of Night Move slowly with their gem-starred light. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?","A": "It presents alternating descriptions of night in a rural area and in a city.","B": "It sketches an image of nightfall, then an image of sunrise.","C": "It makes an extended comparison of night to a human being.","D": "It portrays how night changes from one season of the year to the next.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. Throughout the text, the speaker characterizes nighttime as if it were a person who wears clothing (“a garment” that is “velvet soft” and “violet blue”) and a veil “over her face” and who moves her hands “slowly with their gem-starred light” through her dark hair. Thus, the text is structured as an extended comparison of night to a human being. Choice A is incorrect because the text never mentions any particular location; instead, it focuses on presenting a single description of night as a person with certain clothing and features. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t make any reference to the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on presenting a single image of night as a person with certain clothing and features.

The album contains both autobiographical and reﬂective pieces combining Antrobus’s spoken words with Brennan’s fragmented audio elements and pieces of music to convey how people who are deaf may experience sound, both its presence and absence. Some critics suggest that the album questions the function of sound in the world, highlighting that the experience of sound is multifaceted.

The text ﬁrst introduces the album as being a collaboration between Antrobus and Brennan, then describes the approach taken to produce it, then mentions how critics have said that it calls into question the function of sound. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does mention a collection of spoken word poems, it doesn’t single out one poem as being particularly noteworthy. Additionally, the text doesn’t simply summarize the subject matter—it goes into detail about the content and production of the album. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t provide biographical information about the two artists, and the text doesn’t speculate about the meaning behind the poetry—instead, it relays what some critics have said about the album.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "a disconcerting","B": "an acceptable","C": "an imperceptible","D": "a substantial","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species Potamotrygon rex. As used in this context, “a substantial” effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to ﬁnd out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to ﬁnd out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to ﬁnd out whether age and sex have “an acceptable,” or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for “an imperceptible,” or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "delegate","B": "compose","C": "interpret","D": "renounce","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of John Ashbery’s poems. As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s diﬃcult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s diﬃcult to interpret Ashbery’s poems. Choice A is incorrect because “delegate” means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the diﬃculty that readers have interpreting Ashbery’s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn’t suggest anything about the poems being diﬃcult to delegate. Choice B is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as diﬃcult to “compose,” or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Ashbery’s experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was diﬃcult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn’t address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as being diﬃcult to “renounce,” or give up or refuse, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery’s poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are diﬃcult to interpret, not that the poems are diﬃcult to renounce.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "cf57c1d5","Question": "In 1973, poet Miguel Algarín started inviting other writers who, like him, were Nuyorican—a term for New Yorkers of Puerto Rican heritage—to gather in his apartment to present their work.

The text presents a brief history of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, from how it got started in the ’70s, to its expansion in the ’80s, to its ongoing mission today. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall purpose. The text never mentions Algarín’s motivations. Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall purpose.

The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition. Choice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker addresses a criticism of him that he believes to be false; he doesn’t admit any personal shortcomings.

Roman Raﬁkov and Kedron Silsbee shed light on the subject when they used modeling to determine a complex set of factors that could support planets’ development. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "a discernible","B": "a straightforward","C": "an inconclusive","D": "an unbiased","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea. Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Raﬁkov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how diﬃcult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems.

The text begins by discussing the promise of the future, with positive references to renewal such as “new roads,” “new beating of the drum,” and “fresh seeing.” But with the “new sun,” the text continues, there will still be “the same backs bending” and “the same sad feet” drumming, indicating that these diﬃculties will follow people into this new day. The poem thus considers both the rewards and challenges associated with the repetitiveness of human life. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about how memorable activities are, let alone compare the memorability of activities completed at different times of the day.

The author describes Coketown as having streets that are all very similar and residents who live similarly and do the same work. This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike. Choice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents “do the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same.

I think that will be the best plan.” It sounded like an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only diﬃculty was, that Alice had not the smallest idea how to set about it. As used in the text, what does the word “simply” most nearly mean?","A": "Faintly","B": "Hastily","C": "Easily","D": "Foolishly","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “simply” most nearly means easily, or involving minimal diﬃculty or effort. The text ﬁrst provides Alice’s reﬂections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel’s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be eﬃciently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed beneﬁts of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little diﬃculty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan’s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as “the best,” and the narrator refers to it as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eﬃciently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn’t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn’t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as “the best,” and the narrator refers to the plan as “excellent” and “neatly,” or eﬃciently, arranged.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "d5a16632","Question": "Although the playwrights hoped that their play would be ______ when performed live, critics generally agreed that the production and performances had the opposite effect, wearying audiences instead of energizing them. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "multifaceted","B": "realistic","C": "rousing","D": "subtle","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the play’s effect on audiences. As used in this context, “rousing” means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have “the opposite effect” on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. Choice A is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “multifaceted,” or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice B is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “realistic,” or lifelike or sensible. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "catastrophic","B": "elusive","C": "abrupt","D": "imminent","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reﬂects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversiﬁcation, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains’ entry into the fossil record was sudden. Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversiﬁcation, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversiﬁcation is “elusive,” or diﬃcult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it.

To ensure a proﬁtable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup. Text 2 Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances. Based on the texts, both authors would most likely agree with which statement?","A": "Consumers are more interested in paying subscription fees to stream music than in attending music festivals in person.","B": "Consumers’ growing interest in purchasing experiences is mostly conﬁned to the music industry.","C": "anging consumer behaviors are leading to changes in music-related businesses.","D": "The rising consumer demand for live music festivals also generates higher demand for music streaming platforms.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this inﬂuences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and proﬁtable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identiﬁes music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing “lived experiences.” Text 2 doesn’t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise.

Choice A is incorrect. A 'hypothesis' is 'a theory about something,' but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. 'Aﬃnity' represents 'an inclination or liking toward something.' As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can’t really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect.

As used in the text, what does the word “receiving” most nearly mean?","A": "Denying","B": "Entering","C": "rrying","D": "Hearing","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived speciﬁcally by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake).","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "e07e635c","Question": "In 1877, 85% of California’s railways were already controlled by the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "dominance","B": "creativity","C": "insigniﬁcance","D": "neutrality","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad. As used in this context, 'dominance' means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the ﬁrst transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast. Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word 'creativity' would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad’s control of the ﬁeld and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad controlled the majority of California’s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its 'insigniﬁcance,' or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad’s 'neutrality,' or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would 'neutrality' in the sense of impartiality in a conﬂict be a logical or precise choice since no conﬂict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conﬂict between the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conﬂict in which the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad would take an impartial position.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "e088793d","Question": "Particle physicists like Ayana Holloway Arce and Aida El-Khadra spend much of their time ______ what is invisible to the naked eye: using sophisticated technology, they closely examine the behavior of subatomic particles, the smallest detectable parts of matter. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "selecting","B": "inspecting","C": "creating","D": "deciding","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the work of particle physicists. In this context, “inspecting” means viewing closely in order to examine. The text indicates that as particle physicists, Arce and El-Khadra’s work involves using advanced technology to “closely examine” subatomic particles. In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “selecting,” or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “creating” subatomic particles, or bringing them into existence; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deciding” would mean making a ﬁnal choice or judgment about something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that particle physicists get to choose what is and isn’t visible to the naked eye, especially when the text presents it as fact that subatomic particles are “the smallest detectable parts of matter” and would therefore be invisible.

Even signiﬁcant differences in state taxation have almost no effect on most people’s decisions, while differences in employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate are strong inﬂuences. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "consistent with","B": "representative of","C": "overshadowed by","D": "irrelevant to","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the factors that inﬂuence peoples’ decisions to move to a different state. As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’ decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes.

These unique ______ allow ﬁreﬂies of the same species to ﬁnd each other. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "quantities","B": "decorations","C": "patterns","D": "agreements","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the ﬂashes created by ﬁreﬂies. In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the ﬂashes that ﬁreﬂies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of ﬂashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of ﬂashes are so unique that ﬁreﬂies can use them to ﬁnd other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that ﬁreﬂies produce ﬂashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. Choice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different ﬁreﬂy species produce ﬂashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to ﬁnd them, it doesn’t mention the number of ﬂashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that ﬁreﬂy ﬂashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that ﬁreﬂies use these unique sequences of ﬂashes to ﬁnd other members of their own species, not that the ﬂashes make ﬁreﬂies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “agreements” would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "reviewed","B": "deﬁed","C": "respected","D": "prevented","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. 'Deﬁed' means 'resisted' or 'deliberately disobeyed,' which matches the way Klein broke from the conventions of photography in his time by including features that were generally seen as ﬂaws. Choice A is incorrect. 'Reviewed' means 'analyzed' or 'evaluated,' but that doesn’t really ﬁt the context here. Klein isn’t directly providing any thoughtful examination of the conventions of photography: he’s just breaking all the rules. Choice C is incorrect. 'Respected' can mean 'admired' or 'followed' (as in the case of conventions). It’s clear that Klein didn’t respect conventions, given his use of photographic features that were generally considered 'ﬂaws.' Choice D is incorrect. 'Prevented' means 'stopped,' and Klein did not stop the conventions—they still existed.

The geology of Sterkfontein has caused soil layers from different periods to mix, impeding stratigraphic dating, and dates cannot be reliably imputed from those of nearby animal bones since the bones may have been relocated by ﬂooding. Text 2 Archaeologists used new cosmogenic nuclide dating techniques to reevaluate the ages of A. africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves. This technique involves analyzing the cosmogenic nucleotides in the breccia—the matrix of rock fragments immediately surrounding the fossils. The researchers assert that this approach avoids the potential for misdating associated with assigning ages based on Sterkfontein’s soil layers or animal bones. Based on the texts, how would the researchers in Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined portion in Text 1?","A": "They would emphasize the fact that the africanus fossils found in the Sterkfontein Caves may have been corrupted in some way over the years.","B": "They would contend that if analyses of surrounding layers and bones in the Sterkfontein Caves were combined, then the dating of the fossils there would be more accurate.","C": "They would argue that their techniques are better suited than other methods to the unique challenges posed by the Sterkfontein ves.","D": "They would claim that cosmogenic nuclide dating is reliable in the context of the Sterkfontein Caves because it is applied to the fossils directly.","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer. Text 2 states that the researchers used cosmogenic nuclide dating to 'avoid the potential for misdating' caused by the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as 'challenging' and unreliable. Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been 'corrupted,' but only that traditional dating methods are diﬃcult in Sterkfontein because of ﬂoods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there’s a 'potential for misdating' when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "overlooked","B": "powerful","C": "routine","D": "variable","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable. Choice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it’s possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn’t discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because “routine” means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying.

In this context, “conform to” means to act in accordance with something. The text suggests that in her science ﬁction writing, Jemisin’s willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reﬂects how she treats the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those conventions. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “question” would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science ﬁction writing, suggesting that she may actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that in her science ﬁction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. Rather than suggesting that Jemisin chooses not to “react to,” or act in response to, the standard practices of the genre, this context suggests that she is acting in response to such conventions by deliberately avoiding them.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "haphazard","B": "premeditated","C": "inspirational","D": "fruitless","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yu’s novel. In this context, “haphazard” means marked by a lack of plan or order. The text indicates that the quest featured in the novel, which involves the protagonist bouncing across time, is chaotic and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. This context suggests that the protagonist’s journey seems to be marked by a lack of order. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the journey featured in Yu’s novel involves a character “ricocheting chaotically,” or bouncing in a disordered way, across time and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. It wouldn’t make sense to say that a chaotic journey seems “premeditated,” or characterized by forethought and planning. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t give any indication that readers regard the journey in Yu’s novel as “inspirational,” or as causing extraordinarily creative or brilliant thoughts or actions; instead, the text focuses on the idea that the protagonist’s journey is chaotic, or disordered, and doesn’t give readers a clear sense of what will happen. Choice D is incorrect. Rather than suggesting that the journey featured in Yu’s novel is “fruitless,” or has an unsuccessful outcome, the text focuses on the idea that while reading about the protagonist’s chaotic movements across time, readers are often unsure of what will happen—that is, they don’t know whether the protagonist will be successful in ﬁnding his father.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "ecbd6424","Question": "Rejecting the premise that the literary magazine Ebony and Topaz (1927) should present a uniﬁed vision of Black American identity, editor Charles S.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "proﬁcient","B": "dogmatic","C": "ambiguous","D": "unpretentious","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is 'dogmatic' believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one 'uniﬁed vision' of Black American identity that they prioritize over the 'diverse perspectives' of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic. Choice A is incorrect. 'Proﬁcient' means 'skilled.' Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. 'Ambiguous' means 'unclear' or 'open to multiple interpretations.' However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ('diverse perspectives'). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to 'diverge' from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and ﬁrm (a 'uniﬁed vision'). Choice D is incorrect.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "neglected","B": "redundant","C": "ongoing","D": "uniform","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the samples are too 'small scale' to reﬂect the composition of the asteroid, which probably doesn’t show the same variation on a large scale. This suggests that the mineral composition of the samples are unlikely to be exactly the same from sample to sample. Choice A is incorrect. 'Neglected' means 'suffering a lack of proper care' or 'abandoned,' which doesn’t work here. The text never suggests that the distribution of minerals in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn’t logically follow. Choice B is incorrect. 'Redundant' means 'not or no longer useful or needed,' which is too strong. The text doesn’t suggest that the variation between the samples isn’t a useful ﬁnding at all—just that we can’t assume that the large-scale composition of the asteroid will show the same variation.

As used in this context, “proponent of” means supporter of. The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology. Choice B is incorrect because the phrase “supplement to,” or addition to, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text discusses Sumner’s efforts to increase the number of Black psychology students, but it doesn’t make sense to describe him as an addition to his efforts. Choice C is incorrect because Sumner was already an accomplished psychologist himself when he helped to found the Howard University psychology department. While Black students were the beneﬁciaries of his efforts— that is, they received help because of his efforts—it wouldn’t make sense in this context to describe Sumner as a “beneﬁciary of” opportunities, because he was the one doing the helping. Choice D is incorrect because founding a psychology department at Howard University wouldn’t be a “distraction for” Sumner’s aim to increase the opportunity for Black students to study psychology—that is, it wouldn’t be something that draws Sumner’s attention away from that goal, but rather the opposite.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "f5a636db","Question": "Diego Velázquez was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain during the seventeenth century, but his inﬂuence was hardly ______ Spain: realist and impressionist painters around the world employed his techniques and echoed elements of his style.

As used in this context, “conﬁned to” means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were inﬂuenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez’s inﬂuence was hardly (or almost not) conﬁned to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn’t make logical sense to claim that his inﬂuence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez’s techniques would by deﬁnition be inﬂuenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his inﬂuence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized.

In this context, “enthusiasm for” means excitement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identiﬁed in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions.

In this context, “rarely” means infrequently. The text states that the discovery of the ﬁgure was “truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects are highly prone to rot. This context conveys the idea that wooden objects infrequently survive for as long as the carved ﬁgure has survived. Choice A is incorrect because “sturdily” means strongly, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If wooden objects in general could strongly survive for long periods of time, then the discovery of a wooden ﬁgure that’s around 2,000 years old wouldn’t be surprising. Choice B is incorrect because “carelessly” means accidentally. The text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general accidentally survive despite this.

At ﬁrst “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the ﬁgure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden ﬁgure can’t acknowledge its own precision.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?","A": "It reﬂects a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.","B": "It represents a concern of computer animators who are more interested in creating unique backgrounds and lighting effects than realistic ones.","C": "It conveys the uncertainty among many computer animators about how to create realistic animations using current technology.","D": "It illustrates a reaction that audiences typically have to the appearance of characters created by computer animators.","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, “How lifelike are they?” The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated ﬁlms, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren’t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reﬂect the ﬁlm’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reﬂect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reﬂect ﬁlms’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience’s reactions to characters in animated ﬁlms.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "fc385cd1","Question": "Studying how workload affects productivity, Maryam Kouchaki and colleagues found that people who chose to do relatively easy tasks ﬁrst were less ______ compared to those who did hard tasks ﬁrst. Finishing easy tasks gave participants a sense of accomplishment, but those who tackled hard tasks ﬁrst actually became more skilled and productive workers over time. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "secretive","B": "eﬃcient","C": "outgoing","D": "unsympathetic","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues’ research into how workload affects productivity. In context, “eﬃcient” means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues’ research, people who worked on hard tasks ﬁrst were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks ﬁrst. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks ﬁrst were less eﬃcient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks ﬁrst. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks ﬁrst are less “secretive,” or uncommunicative or silent, than those who do hard tasks ﬁrst. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or eﬃcient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because “outgoing” means openly friendly, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on Kouchaki and colleagues’ research in which people who worked on hard tasks ﬁrst were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks ﬁrst and were therefore less eﬃcient. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks ﬁrst are less “unsympathetic,” or insensitive or unkind, than those who do hard tasks ﬁrst. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or eﬃcient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones.","Difficulty": "Easy"},{"ID": "fca04045","Question": "In the Here and Now Storybook (1921), educator Lucy Sprague Mitchell advanced the then controversial idea that books for very young children should imitate how they use language, since toddlers, who cannot yet grasp narrative or abstract ideas, seek reassurance in verbal repetition and naming. The most enduring example of this idea is Margaret Wise Brown’s 1947 picture book Goodnight Moon, in which a young rabbit names the objects in his room as he drifts off to sleep. Scholars note that the book’s emphasis on repetition, rhythm, and nonsense rhyme speaks directly to Mitchell’s inﬂuence. Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?","A": "The text outlines a debate between two authors of children’s literature and then traces how that debate shaped theories on early childhood education.","B": "The text summarizes an argument about how children’s literature should be evaluated and then discusses a contrasting view on that subject.","C": "The text lists the literary characteristics that are common to many classics of children’s literature and then indicates the narrative subjects that are most appropriate for young children.","D": "The text presents a philosophy about what material is most suitable for children’s literature and then describes a book inﬂuenced by that philosophy.","Answer": "D","Rationale": "Choice D is the best answer. The text starts by introducing Mitchell’s philosophy about using simple, repetitive language in books for young children. Then it describes a book inﬂuenced by that philosophy, Goodnight Moon. Choice A is incorrect. Although two authors are mentioned in the text, they both agree about the type of language that should be contained in books for young children. Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the evaluation of children’s literature. It does provide one view of how children’s books should be written, but never introduces a competing view. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention “many classics of children’s literature.” Instead, it describes an educational theory and identiﬁes one example of a famous children’s book that was inﬂuenced by that theory.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "fd7720f1","Question": "Beginning in the 1950s, Navajo Nation legislator Annie Dodge Wauneka continuously worked to promote public health; this ______ effort involved traveling throughout the vast Navajo homeland and writing a medical dictionary for speakers of Diné bizaad, the Navajo language. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "impartial","B": "offhand","C": "persistent","D": "mandatory","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Annie Dodge Wauneka’s work as a Navajo Nation legislator. As used in this context, “persistent” means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka “continuously worked to promote public health,” traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka’s effort was persistent. Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka’s effort related to public health as “impartial,” or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka’s continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused speciﬁcally on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn’t make sense to describe it as “offhand,” or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health was “mandatory,” or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator. Rather than suggesting that Wauneka’s effort was required for any reason, the text emphasizes the continuous and extensive nature of her work.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "fdb7021d","Question": "In habitats with limited nutrients, certain fungus species grow on the roots of trees, engaging in mutually beneﬁcial relationships known as ectomycorrhizae: in this symbiotic exchange, the tree provides the fungus with carbon, a nutrient necessary for both species, and the fungus ______ by enhancing the tree’s ability to absorb nitrogen, another key nutrient, from the soil. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "overreacts","B": "reciprocates","C": "retaliates","D": "deviates","Answer": "B","Rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ectomycorrhizae relationships. In this context, “reciprocates” means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneﬁcial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of beneﬁt it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneﬁcial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because “retaliates” means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneﬁcial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deviates” would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves beneﬁts for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a beneﬁcial nutrient.","Difficulty": "Medium"},{"ID": "fe4fc413","Question": "Whether the reign of a French monarch such as Hugh Capet or Henry I was historically consequential or relatively uneventful, its trajectory was shaped by questions of legitimacy and therefore cannot be understood without a corollary understanding of the factors that allowed the monarch to ______ his right to hold the throne. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "disengage","B": "annotate","C": "buttress","D": "reciprocate","Answer": "C","Rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the legitimacy of the reigns of French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I. As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was signiﬁcant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so.","Difficulty": "Hard"},{"ID": "ff4c2448","Question": "Like other tribal nations, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation is self-governing; its National Council generates laws regulating aspects of community life such as land use and healthcare, while the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials ______ those laws by devising policies and administering services in accordance with them. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","A": "implement","B": "presume","C": "improvise","D": "mimic","Answer": "A","Rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In this context, “implement” means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials are responsible for “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. Choice B is incorrect because “presume” in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improvise” would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials “mimic,” or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials, is responsible for generating laws. Instead of generating laws, the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials put laws into effect by “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” the laws.","Difficulty": "Medium"}]
